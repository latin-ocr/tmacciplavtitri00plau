SC. 11.] NOTES. 103

larly replaces quidem in Plautus and Terence in such phrases as atque
equidem, quando equidem. In the preceding line unless we write as one
word quandoquidem, we must write quando equidem not quando quidem.
So scio equidem always, not scio quidem. And equidem is not confined
to the first person, it is used no matter what the person is, as Bacch.
974 quadringentos filios habet atque equidem omnis lectos sine probro
and infr. v. 611.

354. qui, instr.=quo‚ as also v. 356, see on v. 14; for the acc.
after fungor see on v. 1.

355. deum uirtute &c. as in v. 346. What Lysiteles means is—we
need not be afraid of becoming inmunes in your sense, for we have
enough to enjoy ourselves and to enable us to be liberal to friends
besides. Δ

356. cfimitati, predicative dat„ like damno esse, lucro esse, usui
esse. This is the only instance of comitati quoted. Comitas has the
same meaning as in v. 333. For beneuolens=amicus, see on v. 46.

357. pernegare, ‘persist in saying no,' as Asin. 322 pernegabo
atque obdurabo.

359. huic. Now that he gives the name Lysiteles points to the house
of Lesbonicus. See on V. 326.

chax-midai, ‘of Charmides) This old gen. form is often found in
Plautus in the gen. of Greek proper names in es, e.g. Periphanai
Epid. 246, 508, 635, but it is also found in other words, familiai
(Amph. 359), audaciai (Amph. 367), impudicitiai (Amph. 821), filiai
(Aul. 295), simiai (Merc. 241), sapientiai (Mil. 236), siluai (Mil. 1154)
810. Lucretius is fond of the form, and it is used by Lucilius, Vergil
and other epic writers. Martial quotes it as the type of early poetry(X1.
90. 5) attonitusque legis ‘terrai frugiferai,' Ι Accius et quidquid Pacuui-
usque uomunt. For the stages by which ᾱῖ passed into the classical
·ae‚ see Lindsay, L. L. p. 381, and sor further instances, Neue, Formenl.
1. p. 12.

360. quin comedit quod fuit, quod non fuit? ‘do you mean the
man who has squandered all and more than he possessed?’ quin is qui rel.
nom. -l- ne‘ interrogatiua, and the elliptic sentence in full would be eine
uis egestatem tolerare qui &c- The interrogative particle, properly be-

longing to the demonstrative or personal pronoun, is often thus affixed
to the relative, as Epid. 449 quemne in adulescentia memorant? ‘do you

mean the man who they say in youth &c.?' ibid. 719, Mil. 16, Rud. 1019.
⁸ quod suit, quod non fuit is a comie inclusive formula equivalent to
an emphatic omnia. So sanda nefanda, dicenda tacenda, digna indigna
