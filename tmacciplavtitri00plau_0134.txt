245. cuculus, ⁴ simpleton.’ The lover’s reply follows.

ocelle, ‘apple of my eye,' ‘darling,' Asin. 664, Catull. 31. 2.

247. ma pendentem ferit, ‘she hits him when he’s down.' The
expression is taken from the custom of tying a slave up to flog him.
He is helpless to resist, and so the lover here. So Most. 1 167 uerberibus
caedere multum pendens, Men. 951 ego te pendentem fodiam stimulis, διο.
There are similar descriptions of the lady’s mercilessness, Truc. 50 ff.
and 425 ff. ἰαωεῆδη, ⁴ forthwith.' But orat without a personal object
is odd, and possibly iam amplius orat should be expunged as a gloss on
pendentem jerit, and ni amplius etiam as another gloss. Thus Langen,
Beitr'age, p. 318, would make two lines

ibi pendentem ferit: non satis id est mali, (pps. ei for mali ?)
quod ecbibit, quod comest, quod facit sumpti.

248. non satis id est. mall. . .quod. facit sumpti. The quod clauses
are subjects to non satis est mali; ‘what she drinks up, what she eats
up, what she squanders is not mischief enough, unless there is more
still) e‘cbz'bit‚ ‘consumes by drinking,’ comest (=c0medit)‚ ‘consumes by
eating‚’ as Truc. 156 uos saltem si quid quaeritis, ecbibitis et comestis.
Whether the words are genuine or not, the construction non satis est ni
is quite correct. Cf. Ter. Phorm. 724 non satis est tuom te afficiam fecisse,
id si non fama adprobat, and Merc. 692 parumne est malai rei...m·
sumptuosus insuper etiam siet ?

250. sumpti, gen. of sumptus, 4th decl. This is in the Comedians
the normal genitive of the 4th declension. Other instances are peni,
v. 254 (though this may be gen. srom the neuter form penum), gemiti,
uicti, tumulti, quaesti, senati. Quintilian in the first cent. A. D. says
that it is 'impossible to decide whether senatus or senati is the proper
gen. of senatm. See Neue, Formenl. 1. p. 352 ff„ Roby, L. G. 399.

251. nox datur: ducitur familia tota, ⁴ an assignation is made:
she takes her whole household with her.' So Bacchis, Ter. Haut.
739 ff„ is represented as escorted by a whole retinue of slaves. familia,
perhaps preserving the original length of the nom. in A-stems. But see
Lindsay‚ L. L. pp. 210 and 373, who thinks that the lengthening is only
metrical, except in the case of Greek words.

252. uestiplica, ⁴ wardrobe-woman,' but A gives uestzspica, which
is the form in Nonius p. 12 and some inscriptions.

unctor, ‘bath-attendant,’ who anointed persons in the bath. Sen.

Epist. 123. 4. Iuv. 111. 76 and vl. 421 speaks of this slave by his .

Greek name, aliptes: ἀλείπτης.
