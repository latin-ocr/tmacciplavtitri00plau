64 TRINVMMVS. [Ac'r 1. ’

come to you?' So id and ulem frequently. Cf. Ouid. Epist. VI. 3.'4
lzoc tamen zjosum debueram scripto certior esse tuo.

36. 111ιιᾱ conducibile: id quod prosint pluribus.

gratiae. Just as irae: ‘different outbursts of anger‚' so gratiae
is properly ‘tokens of favour‚' ‘different exercises of influence.' Plautus
uses the plur. of abstract nouns where the sing. would be used in the
classical period. So v. 490 opulentiae, v. 1028 parsimoniae. But in
Plautus the pure abstraet meaning is rare, and the plur. has its proper
force. Thus astutia, ‘cunning' once only, Capt. 679, but astutiae,
⁴ cunning plans‚' ‘erasty tricks‚' frequently. And so with dolus, fabrica,
fallacia, perfidia and other words the plur. denotes different manifesta-
tions of the cunning, treachery and so forth. See Langen, Beitrage
p. 105 ff.

37. odiosae, or as A odiossae, a genuine spelling. The suffix is
formed of two elements (-went÷ -to) in Latin where Greek uses only one.
The termination=‘having‚' ‘full of’ is in Greek -ecs=fevrs=uant÷s.
Thus χαρίεις (χαρι-Ιέντς) ‘grace—ful,' στονό-εις, ‘woe-ful,’ δολό-εις, ‘guile-
ful.' But the Latin dolosus (Gk. ooxbecs)=*dol0-uenssus from *dolo-
went-to-s. So *odio-went-to-s, *odio-uerissus‚ odionsus, odiosi-us, odiosus.
Cf. retrorsum, retrosum for retro-uersum and see Lindsay, L. L.,
ΡΡ· 352, 353·

38. remoram, ‘hindrance.' So Poen. 928 remora si sit. The
word is used by Lucilius, but as it is against analogy it is afterwards
disused.

rei. Scanned as a monosyllable by the regular synizesis.

SCENE 2 (39-222). Callicles comes out of the house of Charmides,
which he has purchased from Charmides’ son Lesbonicus. As he comes
out he addresses his wife who is inside the house. In eomedy a person
coming out frequently addresses the first words to a person unseen
within the house (as the Roman Comic Stage does not shew interiors).

But the person addressed is made clear by the words used, as here
by uxor.

39. Larem. Each household possessed a Lar, whose image represent·
ing the founder of the family in his loga stood in the lararium or sacra-
rium. Cf. Aul. Prol. 2, ibid. 386, Merc. 834. There were two penates who
stood in the sacrarium one on each side of the Lar. The Lar and the
penates are spoken of under the general name of lares, but the distinction
is preserved in the phrases redire ad larem suom and redire ad penates
suos. See Sonnenschein on Rud. 1207.
