sc. 11.] NOTES. 71

Plautus regularly uses this long form of the infin. dep. and pass, only
at the end of the line.

87. ne suspicer is unusual after prohibere, which usually takes acc.
or acc. with infin. But Terence (Eun. 808) also once has prohibere
followed by ne with subj. The pron. id is governed by suspicer. For
its position see on v. 20.

88. istuc negoti, ‘that business of yours,' viz. Megaronides’ in-
tention announced v. 67. For the construction see ν. 60.

90. quoi pectus sapiat, ‘ of a wise understanding.’ For pectus like
the Homeric φρένες is the seat of the understanding. So Mil. 786.

haud...d010, ‘not with deceit‚' ‘ frankly,' ‘ unreservedly,’ v. 480,
Men. 228.

92, 93. These lines are rejected by some editors as a mere ampli-
fication of sunt quos suspicer. But the triple division is right. Some
he knows to'be friends, others he fancies to be friends, about others he
does not know what to say. The sing. amici, inimici and the use of
pars are more serious objections to v. 93, which I should regard as a
gloss, but keep v. 92. For the form peruenant see on v. 41.

95. siquid...1nprobe, ‘anything you know me to have done soolishly
or wickedly.’ Inscite, in a way that deserves blame but not punishment,
inprobe is a stronger term.

96. id non me accusas, a double aecus„ one of the person, the
other of the charge (cognate). So arguo, iubeo, prohibeo, e-g. Pseud. 13.

98. εἱίιιιὶᾱεεῖ τι for ὅ τι, as v. 148 ausculta siquid dicas.

primumdum omnium, ‘ first of all then.’ Dum, an accus. sing.
neut. from a pronominal stem, is used as an asseverative particle just
like the Greek δή, another case-form from the same stem. Thus primum
dum=⁷rpdirov δή, quidum=⁷r635 δή; α’ἱαίκηιελέγε δή.

100. turpilucricupidum, ‘fond of filthy lucre,’ being Plautus’ trans-
lation of αἰσχροκερδῆ.

101. uolturium, ‘ a vulture‚’ on account of his greediness. We
should say ‘ shark.’ Cf. Capt. 844.

102. hostisne an 01qu comedis, parui pendere, ‘they say that you
care little whether you ruin strangers or fellow-countrymen.' The oratio
obliqua follows uocant quite easily without a fresh verb of saying.
Parui, the so-called gen. of price, is a loc., and a true gen. like pluris in
v. 34 is used on analogy. ‘ F oreigner‚’ ‘stranger‘ is the first meaning of
hostis, ‘enemy‘ is a later sense. See Varro L. L. v. 3 hostis, nam tum
eo uerbo dicebant peregrinum, Cic. Off. 1. 12. 37 hostis apud maiores
nostros z‘s dicebatur, quem nunc peregrinum dicimus. So Cure. 5 si
