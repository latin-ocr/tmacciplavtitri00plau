82 T RlN VMM VS. [ACT 1.

It is an older and properly a sigmatic aorist form. So dixti, duxti,
sparti, misti, &c., with the corresponding infins. dixe, duxe, misse, &c.

v 190. prouinciam, ‘duty‚’ the department or province of work
assigned to a man. So regularly in Plautus, e.g. Mil. 1159 lianc
tibi ego impero prouinciam, Cas. 103 abi dierectus tuam in pro-
uinciam.

192. numquid uis ‘1 ‘ you don’t want anything, do you?' A polite
formula used before leaving, to make sure that you have done all that is
required. So numquid aliud? numquid me aliud? and more fully
numquid nunc aliud me uis? num quippiam aliud me uis?

. 193. sed quid ais? ‘but look herel' A standing formula to
attract a person’s attention before asking him a question, to which this
question (= ‘1 say you,' dis donc) is prefixed. ‘ But what do you say to
the question I'm going to ask you?' Cf. quid tu? v. 116. Other
instanees in this play are vv. 196, 892, 939. In v. 892 the main question
is interrupted by the counter question quid est? just as it is by
Callicles' quid uis? here.

habet: -lzabitat as v. 390.

194. posticulum hoc recepit, ‘he reserved this little building at the
back) Posticulum, a little posticum, i. e. ὀπισθόδομος, only here and
v. 1085. Recepit=excepit‚ legal. Gellius XVII 6. 6 nunc quoque in
uenditionibus recipi dicuntur, quae excipiuntur neque ueneunt. Quo
uerbo Plautus quoque in Trinummo usus est in hoc uersu “Posticulum
hoc recepit, quom aedis umdidz·t,’' i.e. quom aedis uendidit, particulam
quandam, quae post eas aedis erat, non uendidit sed retinuit. And
similarly Nonius p. 384, save that he quotes the line with uenderet
instead of uendidit.

196. 1 sane nunciam. So sane with imper. often, as Asin. 464 at
noscesane, Merc. 500 sequere sane, ibid. 677 da sane, Pers. 198 isane,
ibid. 772 ce‘do sane διο.

196. Callicles has only gone a few paces when Megaronides calls
him back with a fresh question, this time about Lesbonicus’ sister.

nempe apud test? ‘ of course she is at your house?’ Nempe (i.e.
*uena a case—form of the pronominal *no-, as -tem in autem is of *to‚ -Ρ pe)
is used to introduce a question to which an affirmative reply is certainly
expected. So vv. 328, 966, 1076. It is also used to introduce a state-
ment, ‘I mean.’

197. iuxta...cum mea, ‘just as Ι (10 my own daughter.' quta in

Plautus is an adv. =aeque, and always used with cum. So Sall. Cat. 58.
5 iuxta mecum omnes intellegetis.
