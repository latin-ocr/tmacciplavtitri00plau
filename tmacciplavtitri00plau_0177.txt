Sc. η] NOTES. 133

comes very near ecce in meaning, as Mil. 25, P. ubi tu es? A. eccum.
Eccum applies to persons standing by the speaker's side, eccillum,
eccztrtum, to persons at some little distance off.

623. nescioquld, ‘there is some point or other on which they do
not quite agree.’ Nescio quid to be taken together as one word ‘je ne
sais quoi-² Nescioquis scans as a choriambus, nescio as a principal verb
is a cretic, e.g. vv. 849, 960.

celeri gradu, a breach of Athenian propriety. Citizens walked at a
staid pace, only slaves should run. Cf. Poen. 522 liberos homines per
urbem modico magii⁸ par est gradu ire, seruile esse duco fhstz‘nantem
currere.

624. ille reprehendit hune priorem paulo, ‘Lysiteles seizes Les-
bonicus, who is in front of him, by the cloak from behind.’ So Epid.

1 quis properantem me reprehendit pallio? Mil. 59 uel illae quae here
pallio me reprehenderunt.

625. haud ineuscheme, ‘not unbecomingly‚’ ‘quite comme ilfaut,’
standing saeing one another as opponents in a picturesque attitude. Ineu-
scheme is the Gk. εὐσχήμως with a Latin negative prefixed and a Latin
termination. Cf. Mil. 2 1 3 mage, euscheme hercle astitit et dulice et comoe-
dice, i.e. εὖ γε, εὐσχήμως, δουλικῶς, κωμῳδικῶς.

huc aliquantum misnensem, ‘I will at once withdraw a little this
way.’ Aliquantum as ν. 517. The fut. perfect denotes instantaneous
action—so vv. 7 10, 1007—but there is at times so little difference between
fut. and fut. perf. that they are co-ordinated, as Capt. 315 bene merenti
bene prcffuerit, male merenti par erit. ‘The use of the sut. perf. in the
Republican Dramatists in sentences like mox iuero, where it hardly
differs from the fut„ suggests that in its original use the tense was more
of a fut. than of a fut. perf-² Lindsay, L. L. p. 510.

626. est lubido...aud1re, ‘I have a fancy to hear’—est lubido:

lubet, hence the infin. Cf. v. 865, Epid. 97 qui lubidost male loqui?
ibid. 240 id lubidost scire.

Stasimus retires into the angiportum between the houses and listens Δ
to the conversation, unobserved until he shews himself v. 705.

SCENE 2 (627—728). Lysiteles urges Lesbonicus to give him his
sister without dowry. Lesbonicus refuses on the ground that to do so
would be a disgrace to himself. Stasimus listens unseen to the argu-
ment until v, 705, when he declares the victory in argument to lie with

Lysiteles. But neither young man will give way, and Stasimus is left
lamenting.
