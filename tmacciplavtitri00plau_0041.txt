Aulularia the verses are delivered by Lar Familiaris, in the

ζ ’ used his Prologues for a polemical purpose, to gain the favour of

 

the audience and defend himself from the attacks of a rival poet.
πμ It is assumed that Prologues were at one time prefixed to
5 all the Plautine plays. The Bacchides, Epidicus, Mostellaria,

Persa, Stichus have none now. The Curculio has none but has
’ a sort of παράβασις in the Third Act. Only two lines survive of

the Prologue to the Pseudolus. In the Miles and Cistellaria

’ the plot is explained in a scene of the First Act. But in the

Δ Amphitruo and Mercator the Prologue is delivered by one of
the persons of the play. Yet the Prologues to the Amphitruo,

Ἰ Captiui and Poenulus contain references to improvements in the

Theatre——seats &c.—which were not introduced until after the
death of Plautus: that to the Casina declares itself post-Plautine.

, The Prologues to seven plays speak not of ‘poeta' but Plautus
or Maccius, and belong to the revival of Plautine study ‘in the

first half of the 7th cent. A.U.C.' Setting on one side the

- Prologues to the Aulularia, Rudens and Trinummus1, we may
Ξ lay it down that the extant Prologues are post-Plautine.

In any case the Prologue is no part of the play proper. It is
not spoken by one of the characters but by an actor dressed for

ζ’ the purpose—ornatu prologi.

These Prologues merely do what the modern programme or

A play—bill serves to do. The constituent parts of the play proper
’ are dz'uerbz'um and cantica, see p. xxv. All iambic·scenes are

included as dz'uerbz‘um ‘dialogue.' They had no musical ac-
companiment. As cantzca are included both lyrics proper and
scenes declaimed with musical accompaniment.

On the question of the Prologues generally see Ritschl
Parerga 1.180—238,Liebig de prol. Ter. et Plaut. 1859,
Dziatzko de prol. Plaut. et Ter. 1864, Trautwein de prol. Plaut.
indole atque natura 1890.

1 Trautwein adds Cistellaria, Miles, Mercator, and Leo (Plautinische
Forsehungenchap.1v.) goes further still. He includes as Plautine the
Prologue of the Asinaria, which has, he says, a‘ll marks of being
genuine and original)
