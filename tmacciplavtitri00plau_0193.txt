sc. 111.] NOTES. 149

769. mendacuoquom aliquem oportet hominem deligi, ‘ some
fellow with a lying tongue must be picked for the purpose.’ llffendacilo-
quom, see V. 200. The line is given in A only, and by confusion on
a scribe’s part with the interpolated line v. 766 he has written in here
also, after mendaciloquom aliquem, CA. quid is scit facere postea ?
Whatever these words have ousted‚ there must have been a word like
oportet to be followed by an infin. and the aces. mendaciloquom, ἃς.
Oportet may be regarded as certain. Oportet hominem deligi is the
supplement suggested by Leo. Ritschl suggested—to much the same
purport—-esse hominem oportet de soro, For deforo cf. v. 815.

770. confidentem, ‘ an impudent know? See on confidentiloquius,
v. 201.

(767) is homo exornetur graphice ln peregrinum modum, ‘let this
fellow be got up perfectly in foreign fashion.’ With the transposition of
this line from 767 to this place the passage runs smoothly. F irst the
man's appearance is described ν. 768, then his character v. 769. Next,
the person being chosen, he is to be dressed for his part and instructed
what he is to do. Exornare is the technical word used of dressing up
actors for their part.

graphice, a pseudo-Greek adv.‚ with a Latin termination like those
quoted on v. 625, from graphicus (γραφικός). Graphicus means as like
as a picture is like its original. So v. 936 graphicum nugatorem, ‘ a
perfect picture of a humbug,' ‘the beau ideal of a humbug,’ v. 1024
graphicum furem, ‘a living picture of a thief‚’ v. 1139 pergraphicus
sycophanta, Epid. 410 seruom graphicum, ‘ an ideal slave‚' Stich. 570
graphicum mortalem, ‘a picture of a man.' The adv. graphice, Pers.
306 nunc ego huic graphice facetus fiam. So here graphice is dressed
precisely as a foreigner ought to be dressed, so as to make him a living
picture of a foreigner 3 perhaps tout-afait will render the adverb.

771. ex Seleucia, see v. 112.

772. uerbis patris, ‘in his father’s name,' ‘ from his father.'

773. illum bene gerere rem, &c. Oratio obliqua aster nuntiet.
‘ Tell him that his father is doing well, &c.' Illum here and eum in the
next line both refer to the same person. Thus the pronoun is repeated
in a different form, vv. 741, 742, ei...illi both referring to uirgini,
Asin. 527 illos qui dant, eos derides, Epid. 51 quid istanc quam emit?
quanti eam emit ?

776. mi=Lesb0nic0. Hiatus at the caesura is legitimate, and it is
unnecessary to change illi to illic.

777. perge porro dicere. See on v. 162.
