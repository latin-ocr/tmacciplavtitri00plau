 

sc. ιι] NOTES. 191⁴

1165. meum corrumpi quia perpessu's tutum, ‘because you allowed
&c.' The construction follows Charmides’ own word suscensuz' and is
not affected by Lysiteles’ quid ego feci?

1166. si id mea. uoluntate factumst δια, ‘if that was done with
my consent, you have grounds for being angry with me! A gap is
marked after this line, the lost verses being supposed to contain
Lysiteles' explanation. But this single line implies sufficiently his
innocence, which we need not suppose him to be at pains to prove.
The spectators are aware of the facts, they know that with the best will
in the world Lysiteles could not have restrained Lesbonicus, and it is
in accordance with Plautus’ custom to cut short such explanations at the
end of the play. See on ν. 1097. Lysiteles feels quite easy about him-
sels, he is anxious to plead for his friend and does so at once. The
marks of the persons are disordered in the MSS. But there cannot be
any reason for making Callicles speak with Charmides. Their expla-
nation is Over and done with. The interlocutor here must be Lysiteles.
Ussing and Goetz and Schoell make the speaker Callicles, but Niemeyer
and Leo are, Ι think, certainly right in assigning the dialogue on from
v. 1163 to Lysiteles.

1167. sed sine me hoc aps te impetrare quod uolo=sed sine me
impetrare abs te lzoc quod uolo.

1168. ut ea missa facias omnia, i.e. uolo ut ea omnia missafacz‘as,

‘I want you to forgive it all.' MSS. missam, variously corrected missa
and missum.

1169. quid. quassas caput? a sign of violent emotion‚ whether anger
or, as here, sorrow. Cf. Asin. 403, Merc. 600. Charmides is greatly
moved, he does not ‘shake his head' as we use the phrase, i.e. in the
'sense of refusing, as the next words shew.

1170. quom 1110 itast ut esse nolo, cf. vv. 46 and 307. In accord-
ance with v. 307 Ritschl inserts eum before esse. On quom see v. 617.

1171. leuiorem, ‘have little weight,’ ‘have not much influence with

,
ῐῐιθ’117τῗὶ ἓιξξῖᾗωετ. male promerita, ut merita sunt, si ulcisci non

licet, ‘it is a wretched thing if one cannot punish ill deserts, as they

deserve.'

11⁷4. Lysiteles goes up to the door of the house and knocks. Les-
bonicus is in his posticulum, to which access from the stage is supposed
to be through the street—door of the house. See on v. ¹08 5. But being
in the posticulum he knows nothing of his father’s arrival or subsequent

events.
