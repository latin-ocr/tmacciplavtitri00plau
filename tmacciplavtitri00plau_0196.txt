1 52 TRIN VMM VS. [ACT 111.

according to the Mss- of Plautus. Thus Cas. 602 eapsa A, Pseud. 833
eaepsae A, Truc. 114 eum ipsum A, umsum BCD i.e. eumpsum. The
first element only is declined in the forms here, and also eumpse Pers.
603, eampse Poen. 272 &c- See Lindsay, L. L. p. 441.

802. quin tu hinc amoues et te moues ¹7 ⁴ why don't you move 'and
remove yourself from here?’ Comedy is fond of giving emphasis by
repetition, e.g. v. 130. But there does not seem to be much point in
the repetition here. Perhaps moues was a gloss on amoues or vice
versa. Leo suggests quin tu hinc abis et thensaurum moues? That
would give inde an antecedent which otherwise is some way off.
Monere: κινεῖν is appropriate for ‘disturbing' a boarded treasure‚ e.g.
Hor. C. 111. 21. 6.

803. auri ad hanc rem quod eat est, i.e. quod auri sut est ad hanc
rem. Deprome as v, 756. The gold is to be taken out that it may be
in readiness when the Sycophant has accomplished his errand with the
letters.

806. at enim, see on v. 705.

807. diem conficimus, quom iam properatost opus, ‘we are wasting
the whole day, when we ought to get to work at once.’ Quom is
probably a true correction for quod. The sense is not ‘we are spend-
ing the whole day on a matter where we want haste‚' but ‘at a time
when we want haste.’ On the construction of opus see v, 584.

808. me uide, ‘trust me? A phrase regularly used to reassure,
whereas specta me is used in bragging and threatening. Cf. Rud. 680
me uide, and see Langen, Beitrage, p. 276.

809. dicere, infin. in apposition to illa causa.

810. portitores, v. 794·

811. quid illum putas? an elliptic colloquial question in which
dicere or facere, here facere, must be supplied according to the context.
So Bacch. 208 ut eam credis? Cure. 59 ut illam censes? Merc. 352
quemadmodum existumet me?

813. quiduis probare poterit, ‘he will be able to make Lesbonicus
believe anything.' The subject to poterit &c. is Sycophanta, named in
the next line lzic, and suggested by dicere v. 809.

815. de foro, the haunt of loafers waiting for a job.

816. Bracketed by Ritschl and not wanted. It is easily made up
from v. 775 and v. 788.

817. meditatum probe, ‘well-drilled in his part.' Medianum, pass.

as Epid. 375 eam permedz‘tatam meis dolis...mittam, Mil. 903 probe medi-
atam utramque duco.
