as v. 628. Thus Asin. 224 haud est ab re aucupis, ‘contrary to the
fowler’s interests‚' Capt. 338 dum ab re nequid ores, but Pseud. 336
ex tua re non est, ‘it is not to your interest,’ Capt. 386 quod in rem
recte conducat tuam, ‘what would be really to your interest‚' &c.

Blanditur is a gloss which has wrongly been incorporated into the
text.

239 a. blandiloquentuluS, ‘ fair-spoken‚’ a Plautine diminutive,
ἅπαξ εἰρημένον. harpago :dipwa}.

2391). cuppas, ἅπαξ εἰρημένον,;“ῐοη(1 of cuppedia' (Stich. 714 nil
moror cuppedia), i.e. ‘dainty,’ ‘lickerish.’

elegans, ‘fastidious.'

240. latebricolarum‚ proleptic‚ ‘he seduces men and makes them
haunt low places.' In the next line the MSS. agree in blandus, inops.
Blandus occurs rather soon after blandiloquentulus, but that in itself is
not decisive against the word. Inops is probably right, quoniam inops
est, celata indagat, Hor. Epist. 1. 18. 98.

241. celatum, short gen. plur., the old form. The termination -o‘m,
Greek -ων, would in time in Latin become -ὅηι, then -ἄηι, e. g. socium in
S,.C. de Bacch. But as A-stems took both in Greek and the Italic
languages the termination -cis0‘m (ΜουσάσωνεΜουσάωνεΜουσῶν and
Movadwv=Musdr22m)‚ a gen. plur. of O-stems was formed in Latin
Ι with the suffix strum, in old Latin -ᾶνοηῑ, which by Cicero’s time
altogether ousted the older -om, -um. See Lindsay, L. L. p. 401.

242. nam qui amat quod amat &c.‚ ‘for as soon as the lover is
smitten and stricken down by the kisses of the beloved (i.e. sauiz‘s eius
quod amat), forthwith his substance slips away and melts,' ‘slips and
slides away.’ As qui amat regularly=amat0r‚ so quod amat frequently
zanu‘ca, e.g. Merc. 744 nam qui amat quod amat si habet, id lzabet pro
cibo. quom extemploze’wez τάχιστα, vv. 49² and 7² 5. It is renewed
by ilico in the apodosis, as Mil. 1176 quom extemplo hoc erit sactum,
ubi intro haec abierit, ibi tu ilico facito &c.‚ and Epid. 563 postquam
audiui z‘lic0‚...c0ntinu0 argentum dedi. Sagittatus, perculsus and lalli-
tur, liquitur are pairs of parallel words juxtaposed with asyndeton.
Cf. turbant, miscent, v. 285, and see on v. 210. Sagt'ttatus is scanned
sagittatus, and sauiis becomes a dissyllable by synizesis. So by synizesis
v. 235 omnam, and v. 269 obnoxi—ds.

244. da mihi hoc...si audes. These are the words of the amica,
‘Give me this, my honey, if you love me, if you please.' Sz‘ audes, ‘if
you please,' often contracted sodes as v. 562, si uis contr. sis v, 650,
sz’ uultis contr. sultis.
