96 TRIN VMM VS. [Ac‘r 11.

‘ cover with infamy,’ v. 693. The whole sentence is a good example of
the Latin co·ordination of contrasted clauses. In Greek also contrasted
clauses are co-ordinated‚ but made clearer by μέν...δέ. In English the
first clause is subordinated to the second and introduced by ‘ while ’ or
‘though.’ See Prof. Mayor's note on Cic. 11. Phil. 110. There arc
similar sentences vv. 645, 646, also v. 832.

293. hisce ego de artibus gratiam facio, ‘about these practices
(see v. 72) I let you off following them or tainting your mind with them?
The phrase gratiam facere alicui alicuius rei or de aliqua re means ‘to
renounce something in favour of someone,’ and may be used (1) literally
‘to give up,' or (2) ‘to let off! Thus Cas. 372 de istac Casina huic
nostro nilico gratiam facias, ‘give up‚' Rud. 1414 iuris iurandi uolo
gratiam facias, ‘let off.' See Sonnenschein’s note ad loc. For alicuius
or de aliqua re a ne with subj. clause may be substituted, as Mil. 576
quam benigne gratiam fecit, ne iratus esset, ‘how kindly he dispensed
with being angry.’ So here Philto tells his son that ‘ he lets him offl’
‘dispenses with his following’ the practices in question. ‘He is not
anxious that his son should follow these practices' is by emphatic
meiosis equivalent to saying ‘ he is anxious he should not follow them.’

294. ne colas neue inbuas ingenium=ne eas colas neue eis inbuas
ingenium. Inbuere carries with it the notion that the thing tainted is
neto (so ‘ your young mind’ here) or that the action is done for the first
time. So Sen. Troad. 215 rudem cruore regio dextram inbuit, ‘stained
sor the first time a hand unstained before,' Mart. VIII. 51. 17 inbuat
egregium digno mihi nectare munus, ‘the first time your splendid gift (a
cup) is used may it be filled with wine worthy of it.’ Philto does not
wish his young son’s unformed mind to take its first colouring from the
corrupt ways of his degenerate contemporaries.

295. antiquis, ‘good old ways‚’ as v. 7²·

29⁷„ m‘l ego istos moror faeneos mores, ‘l don’t care about those
impure morals‚ thick and muddy.' Fauces, ἅπαξ εἰρημένον, ‘full of lees
and sediment‚' like wine from the bottom of the cask. The metaphor
is continued in turbidos which, applied to liquid, means ‘thick, muddy,'
the opposite of liquidus. But turbidos may be a gloss on faeceos. Nil
moror, ‘I do not detain‚’ ‘I dismiss‚’ hence ‘I do not value‚’ e.g. Stich.
714 nil moror cuppedia, ‘I don't care about dainties,’ Hor. Epist. 1. 15.
16 uina nilzil moror illius orae, Verg. Aen. V. 400 nec dona moror.

298. boni, ‘men of position.' See on v. 272.

299. haec tibi sl mea imperta capesses, ‘take upon yourself,’
‘take in hand my directions.’ So Verg. Aen. 1. 77 iussa capessere.
