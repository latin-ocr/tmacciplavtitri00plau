Stasimus poses as a moneyed gentleman who can lend a friend a large
sum—yet the land they are in danger of losing is all that keeps him and
his master from starvation.

Exit Stasimus to the Forum, i. e. to the right.

SCENE 3 (729—819). The previous scene has shewn how great the
difficulty about the dowry is. Now we are shewn how Callicles tries to
surmount it. He has gone (v. 614) to consult Megaronides. They enter
in conversation; Megaronides finally suggests getting a man to pretend
he has come from Charmides, and thereby secretly conveying part of
the hidden treasure as the girl's dowry. But this plan when put into
execution (Act IV.) only complicates matters.

Metre—Iambic Trimeters.

730. prosus is to be taken with nullo modo. So Ter. Haut. 894
nihil prorsus, Cic. nat. deor. 111. 8. 21 nullo modo prorsus assentior.
On prosus for* prorsus (pro-uorsus) see v. 182. Potest is scanned potis-t,
and fieri is not omitted as it is e.g. v. 628.

731. namque, ‘ no Ξ sor.’ Namque is elliptic, ‘ (you are right) for '
—see on v. 61. Cf. v. 747.

733. quom is here followed by the subj„ but it will be noticed that
it follows another subj. See on v. 617. Cf. Bacch. 908 ut castigem,
quomsaciat, Mil. 1342 nequeo quin fleam, quom abs te abeam.

eius rem, ‘ property belonging to her,’ viz. the treasure.

Ritschl assumes a gap here, containing lines spoken by Callicles to
the effect—‘What I don’t know is whether to let the marriage go
forward now or wait until Charmides returns.’ But if we suppose that
Megaronides continues almost without listening to what Callicles says,
perhaps no gap need be assumed. And this is Leo’s view.

735. nuptum conlocet, ‘ settle her in marriage,’ like nuptum dare,
&c- expectare ut, as Cic. Cat. 11. 27, Rosc. Am. 82, Liv. xxm. 31· 7,
and manere ut, Stich. 58.

736. dare te ei dicas, ‘tell him that you will give.’ Dare=datu-
rum esse, see on v. 5.

739. te ln crimen populo ponat, ⁴ expose you to popular slander.'

⁷40. non temere...benig·num go together, ‘ they would say that
you were not genereus to the girl for nothing‚' ‘ that you had good
reason for your generosity.’ Non temere, non forte, non frwtra=ofm
ἐτός, ‘ not for nothing.’

⁷43. columem te sistere illi, ‘ that you did not pay her the dowry
in full, as it was given you.’ Calamis, old Latin :incolumis.
