1 76 TRIN VMM VS. [ACT lv.

14, 87, p. 303 G.), ‘tortus ita ut oculi eius creparent! The more com-
mon reading, Becker’s collicrepz'dae, agrees well with cruricrepidae,
⁴ with clanking irons on neck and leg‚’ cf. Capt. 357 collus collari caret.
Loewe suggests crun‘strepz'dae from the crurzsragz‘um, often mentioned
as a punishment of slaves, Asin. 474, Mil. 156, Poen. 886, Pseud. 130,
Rud. 816. In any case both words are made to look like Greek
patronymics, as if the ruffians were the scions of honoured houses.

ferriteri (ferrum, tero), because they wear out irons, as Capt. 888, or>
possibly ‘ iron-filers,’ from their filing through their irons to escape, like
compedium tritor Pers. 420. But probably both that phrase and
ferriteri here only mean ‘fetter-wearers,' not ‘filers‚’ cf. Most. 356
plagipatidae‚ ferritribaces uiri. Mastzgia (μαστιζγίας), any ‘jail or
gallows bird!

1022. inter eosne homines condalium te redipisci postulas ἰ
‘among a set of fellows like that do you expect to get back a ring ?'
The question is resumed in a slightly different form after the parenthesis.
It began an uero, quia..., it should continue eo, &c., but the quia is not
answered, the simple question is picked up again.

1023. eorum quiuis surrupuit currenti cursori solum, ‘any one of
them has been known to snatch the shoe off a runner as he ran.’ The
line is meant to shew how lightning-swift their movements were. Solum
is ‘the shoe-sole,' as Bacch. 332, Cure. 297. The MSS. give at the
beginning of the line quorum eorum unus. Leo retains quorum eorum,
and can produce authority for doing so. But to the ordinary eye it
seems to be, as Ussing says, ‘dittographz'a aperta) Unus cannot well be
takenzrls, ‘many of them have been known to snatch'-—if unus is
retained it must mean that ‘one of them has done it,’ and it is quoted
as a great feat. But we want a description that will apply to all, they
are all finished thieves, and therefore Ι follow Ussing in eorum quiuis.

1024. ita. me di ament, graphicum furem, ⁴ as I hope to be saved,
a droll knave,' ‘a chef d'oeuvre of knavery.' On ita me di ament see
v. 447, on graphicum v. 769.

1025. θρὶῡὶιεοεωεέπιθήκην, ‘ unless I am going in addition to loss
to throw in trouble (i.e. petendi laborem) as well’ (pour fizire comble).
Cf. Ar. Vesp. 1391 κάξέβαλεν ἐντευθενὶ ἄρτους δέκ’ ὀβολῶν κάπιθήκην
τέτταρας. The Latin is auctarium.

1026. quin tu quod periit periisse ducis ‘2 ‘why don't you con-
sider that what is lost is lost ?’ Cf. Catull. 8. 2 et quod uides penkse,
perditum ducas.

cape nemerim, ‘ ’bout ship,’ ‘bring her round.’ Cf. Merc. 875 ff.
