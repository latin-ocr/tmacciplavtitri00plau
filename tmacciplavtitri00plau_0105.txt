ACT 1. sc. 1.] NOTES. 61

Megaronides and Callicles, who appear in the first Act. In this Pro·
logue, as in Asin„ Cas„ Merc.‚ are given (Ι) the Greek name of the
play, (2) the Greek poet, (3) the Roman adapter, (4).the Latin title.

1¹1. ei (nom. pL), scanned by synizesis as a monosyllable, just as ei

dat. sing. is scanned in v, 15.
18. Thensauro, dat. by attraction to the ease of fabulae. Cf. v. 8

and Asin. Prol. 10 there quoted, also v. 20. On the spelling Then-
saurus see Arg. r.

19. Plautus uortit barbare. On the use of the name Plautus, not
poeta, in a genuine Prologue see Trautwein l.c. pp. 23, 24.

uertit barbare=uortzt Latine. It is a striking proof how essentially
Greek in tone these plays are that whenever it is necessary to refer to
anything Latin in true Greek fashion it is styled ‘foreign' (βάρβαρος).
Thus Cure. 150 fite causa mea ludii barbari: Roman play-actors, Mil.
211 poetae barbaro--a Roman poet (Naeuius), Stich. 193 mores barbaros

= Roman customs.
⁷ 20. Trinummo, dat. by attraction as before. Cf. v. 391 Lesbonicost
nomen, i.e. est ei nomen Lesbonico. Luxuria asks in the poet's name, as

. if the request came from himself, that his name for the play, viz. T ri—

nummus‚ should be accepted by the spectators. Cf. Asin. Prol. 12
Asinariam uolt esse, si per uos licet.

hoc belongs to nomen, ‘ he asks that this play should be allowed to
’ keep this name.' For the position of the demonstrative cf. vv. 28, 87,
153.

22. tantumst, ‘so much for this,’ ‘that is all '=Cicero’s sed haec
hactenus, Herodotus’ τοσαῦτα μὲν περὶ τούτων εἰρήσθω. Cf. Cas, Prol.
87, Merc. 283 where the words are used in the same sense.

adeste cum silentio, to bespeak a quiet hearing for the play, like
Asin. Prol. 14 date benigne operam mz'lzi.

ACT Ι. SCENE 1 (23—38). Enter Megaronides. He is greatly
disturbed by what people are saying of his friend Callicles, and comes
resolved to remonstrate with him on his conduct.

Metre throughout the Act Iambic T rimeters.

23. noxiam, ‘blame,’ as Ter. Phorrn. 22 5 ad defendendam noxiam.
Plautus and Terence do not use the form usual later, viz, noxa. Meritus
is either active (deponent) or passive. Meritam here and commerita
v, 26 are passive, whereas in Ter. Phorrn. 1014 esse in lzac re culpam
meritum non nego, and Aul. 738 me cuspam commeritum scio, they are
actlve.
