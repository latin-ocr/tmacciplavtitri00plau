and the like. Cf. Ter. Adelph. 990 quia non iusta iniusta, prorsus
omnia omnino obsequor. Soph. Elect. 305 τὰς οὔσας τέ μου καὶ τὰς
ἀπούσας ἐλπίδας.

362. mentire, ‘you are mistaken.’ So ψεύδεσθαι. Note that men-
tire, not mentiris, i.e. the form of and sing. dep. and pass. in -re not in
-ris, is the usual form in old Latin and even in Cicero. See Lindsay,
L. L. p. 5 3 3.

363. ipsus fingit fortunam sibi, ‘is the fashioner or architect of his
own fortune! Cf. the proverbial faber est quisque fortunae suae (Appius,
Sall. de Republ. Ordin. 1). In the next line eo is abl. caus.=ideo, and
malus=‘unskilful' )( fictor probus.

366. multa ini opera opust ficturae=illi opus est multa opera
ficturoe, ‘he needs much pains in fashioning.' Ficturae=fingena¹iand
is used sor the sake of the paronomasia fictztrae..fict0rem.

366. expetit, ‘desires to be a skilful fashioner of the conduct of
lise! Cf. v. 229. Expetit se esse is like postulat se conicere v. 237 b.

admodum, i.e. ad modum, ‘to the measure or limit‚’ so ‘fully,’
‘completely.’ ‘But my friend here is quite a stripling' and therefore
has not had time ‘to fashion his fortune.' Admodum scarcely occurs in
poetry outside the comic poets. Another use of the word in Plautus is
in an emphatic affirmative=⁷rdvv γε, ‘quite so,' e.g. v. 421, Rud. 143
and 269.

367. apiscitur, ‘is obtained,' the only passage in Plautus where the
word is used passively, but Asin. 279 indipiscet, Aul. 775 indipisces,
a compound is used in an active form which makes this passive use
natural. For the meaning cf. Publ. Syrus, Sent. 590 sensus, non aetas
inuenit sapientiam. The wise man, like the poet, nascitur non fit.

368. sapienti...cibust‚ ‘age gives a relish, adds a piquancy, to
wisdom, but wisdom is the food of age.' Sapiens is concrete for the
abstract sapientia. Condimentum, ‘a relish‚‘ is an improvement but not
essential or indispensable; cibus, necessary nourishment‚ which it is
impossible to forgo. In Greek μέν...δέ would make the sentence
clearer. See on v. 292. But see Langen, Plaut. Stud. p. 375.

369. agedum. See on v. 98. A gives this line, the Palatine MSS.
give vv. 369, 368 after v. 361. Transp. Muretus, Acidalius.

nu quicquam, ‘nothing at all.’ Nil is strengthened by quicquam, as
Asin. 146 nil quicquam meret, Bacch. 1036 nil quicquam dabo, Merc.
507 and 666, nemo quisquam Pseud. 808.

3⁷2. eo, ‘ yes! (by that),’—an affirmative answer given by repeating
the word of the question.
