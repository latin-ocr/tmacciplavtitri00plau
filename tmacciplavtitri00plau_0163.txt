tare dead, then you would be' &c. Ita sis ut nomen cluet, ‘be in accord—
·ance with thetrue sense of the word.’ Cf. v. 309, v. 620, King Lear 1.
1. 270 ‘I am most loath to call your faults as they are named)

’ 49⁷ hic.. ‚non esse, ‘are not in question, ‘that it is not a question
of. ’ Neglegere=‘ slightss i. e. ‘undervaluess ’

500. quae res bene uertat, and again v. 572, uertat is intransitive,
*‘tu'rn out,' and 'the formula=qu0d felix faustumque sit, and the like.
But v. 502 di bene uertant, ‘may heaven bless the union‚’ the verb is
trans. ‚

habeon pactam? ‘is it a bargain?' With pactam we may under-
stand either sororem, when pactam means ‘betrothed '—cf. v. 1183 haec

501. pro di inmortale& condlcionem quoius modi, ‘good heavens!

with reference to v. 427. A betrothal was a stipulatio, and when a
contract was made verbally, if it was to be binding, the necessary form

spondeo when he went bail for his friend and lost his money, he could
not say spondeo now, when he had everything to gain and nothing to lose.

504. nuno hle, quom opus est, non quit dicere, ‘now in the present
case, when it is wanted, he cannot say it.' The object to dicere is
spondeo, easily supplied from the preceding ‘spondeo' dicebat: lzic adv.
