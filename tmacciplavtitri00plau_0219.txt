three cups make you sorget your memory?’ Plautus joins obliuisci with
the acc. only as v. 1014. potirium (ποτήριον), also Stich. 694.

1018. an uero, quia, &e., ‘do you mean to say that because you
drank there with a set of decent fellows, men who would have no diffi-
culty in keeping their hands off what was not theirs—.’ The lines are a
piece of sels-address in conversational style. Frugi and sacz'le cohiberent
are manifestly ironical. The sentence begins an uero quia, which
should be answered by eo postulas. But after the two parenthetical
lines describing his companions, the question is put directly without the
answering eo, the description being merely summarised in inter eos.

1020. The names are Greek, and meant to express the thievishness
of their owners. But some of them are very difficult and doubtful.
They have been discussed by Ritschl (Opusc. 111.) and Spengel (praef.
p. vii.) with very different results. Leo makes some excellent suggestions
in his critical footnote.

Jrushus. The choice seems tr lie between (1) Spengel's Trochus
(τροχός), which if adopted is more naturally referred to the speed with
which the thief makes off than to the torture- wheel, and (2) Leo's Struthus
(Στρουθός) ; ‘ Sparrow’ is a likely enough name sor a thies, the more so
if, as seems to be the case, some of the other names imply the snatching
up of crumbs or fragments, thieving on a small scale.

Cercomkus, read Cz'rconz‘cus (Leo), Κιρκόνυχος, ‘ Hawkclaw,‘ cf.
Pseud. 852 miluinis aut aquilinis ungulis. Crinnus is referred by
Spengel to a kind of torture. There are many suggestions: (ι) Crinas,
Hermann (κρίνον), which is variously taken as ‘ poor,' or ‘a kind of
cake (μάζα), both on the authority of Hesychius, Suidas, and others.
Better suggestions seem to be (2) Crimnus (Scaliger), ‘Crumb‚’ for which
Leo compares Herondas VI. 5 τᾶλφιτ’ ἢν μετρῇ, τὰ κρῖμν’ άμιθρεῖς,
(3) Crius‚ ‘xptos quasi τοιχωρύχος)

Cercobulus, (1) Ritschl suggests Crz'colabuszo λαμβάνων κρίκον, i.e.
condalium, ‘Ring-grabber,' (2) Spengel, Cerdobuluszxe‘p605, qui lu-
crum spectat, ‘Gain·greedy‚’ (3) Leo, Cercnobulus (κέρχνη, Hesych.
κέρκνοςε ἱέραξ).

Collahm, about the form there is no doubt. The meaning is
variously taken to be (1) from κόλλαβοςεμικρὸς ἀρτίσκος, ‘ a roll,' a thin
starveling creature, ‘ Loaflet,’ (2) a hybrid word, ‘ μειξοβάρβαρον, quasi
συλλαβών,’ ‘ Snatcher.'

the crackling-eyed and clanking-legged line, iron-wearing jail-birds.’
Oculicrepidae is read on the strength of Schoell's quotation (exc. Vales,
