92 TRIN VMM VS. [Aer 11.

264 b. procul abhibendust atque abstandus, ‘ one must keep love
at a distance and stand aloof from it.’ A blu'bendus is ἅπαξ εἰρημένον, and
a correction of the MSS„ A adhibendus, CD abtz’nendus. Leo proposes
to change to the second person throughout,

mille modis, Amor, ignorandu's,
procul abhibendu’s atque abstandu’s.

But this weakens the effect of the direct address to Love‚ v. 266. For
the use of the gerundive of the neuter verb absto cf. v. 1¹59 placenda
est dos and Epid. 74 puppis pereundast probe. ‘The use dates from a
time when the border-line between verbs transitive and verbs neuter had
not been sharply drawn.' If this view is correct, to change to the
gerund, as has been proposed—eg. procul apsbitena'um atque abstan-
dumst, ⁴ one rnust withdraw to a distance and stand aloof‚'—is unnecessary‚
and harsh aster the gerundive (ignorandus) in the preceding line.

266 a. praecipitauit, intrans., ‘has fallen,' ‘plunged.' See on
v. 146. ⁸

265 b. quasi saxo saliat, ‘ thanis he were to leap from the rock.' An
allusion to the punishment of criminals by throwing thern from a height,
κατὰ, τοῦ κρημνοῦ among the Greeks, from the Tarpeian Rock (Liv. xxv.
7. 14) at Rome. Saxo, a bare abL, as ν. 639 officio migrat. This is
naturally more common with compound verbs, as v. 601 exturbauit
nostris aedibus, v. 650 corde expelle desidiam tuo.

quasi: ‘than if’ in old Latin. In Plautus there are at least
three other passages, Aul. 231 magis haud...gnatus quasi numquam
siena Mil. 481 neque... plus curat quasi non seruitutem seruiat, Truc.
340 me nemo magis respiciet, quasi...ficerim mortuos. But Poen. 240
cogita, amabo, item nos perhiberi quam sz' salsa muriatica esse autu-
mantur we ge't quam si in the sense of quasi, ‘as.’ The classical
differentiation between quasi, ‘ as ' and quam si, ‘ than if ’ had not yet
been made. See Lindsay, L. L. p. 607.

266. tuas res tibi habeto, ‘ pack up your traps and go,’ a jocular
turn of the regular formula of divorce, given in full Amph. 928 ualeat,
tibi habeas res tuas, reddas meas, Cic. 11. Phil. 69 illam mimam suas res
sibi habere iussit, Mart. X. 41. 1 ueterem, procule-ia, maritum Ι deseris,
atque iubes res sibi habere suas.

267. fuas, an archaic form, properly an optative—see on v. 6—used
as pres. subj. So v. 594 suat, Bacch. 156 suam, also at the end os the
line, and as an intenti0nal archaism Verg. Aen. x. 108 Tros Rutulusne
fuat «Sec. In place of forsitan Plautus has fors fuat an, e-g. Pseud. 432.
