sc, 11.] NOTES. 137

L. L. p. 517—is in Plautus intensive rather than disjunctive. S'ee
Langen, Beitrage‚ p. 69 ff. It allows a choice--then a choice between
altematives‚ and so becomes disjunctive. Other imperatives that have
become particles are age, puta, and em if it is from eme.

656. ut rem patriam et gloriam maiorum foedarim meum, ‘how
1 have squandered my patrimony and sullied the fair fame of my fore-
fathers! Foedarim is strictly applicable only to gloriam, with rem
patriam it is used by a zeugma. For the short gen. pl. meum see
on v. 241.

657. scibam ut. esse me deceret, facere non quibam miser,
‘1- knew how Ι ought to behave, alas! Ι could not put my knowledge
into practice.’ This is really a co-ordination of contrasted clauses
=‘tlzouglz I knew &c.‘ The adverb ut=adj. qualem, as regularly in
. this idiom, see v. 46. Scibam...quibam are fourth conjugation imperfects
in -ibam, which are very common in the Dramatists. Lucretius v. 934
writes nec scibat ferro molirier arua, and the Augustan poets use the
forms where the ordinary form would not come into the line, as Vergil
Aen. VI. 468 lenibat. Ibam, peribam, quibam, nequibam continued to
be the classical forms. Cf. fourth conj. futures in -bo, as scibo, which

Δ however in the classical period survive only in isolated cases, such as

lenibo, Prop. 111. 21. 32.

658. ita, ‘so completely‚’ ‘so true is it that,' see v. 544. Notiee the
alliteration with u, perhaps ‘bound by the bonds of Beauty.’ Cf. Bacch.
180 ita me uadatum amore uinctumque adtines.

aptus, the reading of A, should be kept, explained by Nonius, p. 234,
aptum connexum et colligatum significat, ‘tied to idleness I fell into loss.’
Fraudem = damnum.

659. et. tibi nunc, proinde ut merere, summas habeo gratias.
The plur. gratias with habeo is not in accordance with the regular
idiom, which is grates plur., but gratiam sing. See Langen, Beitrage‚
p. 12 ff. But this is not an ordinary expression of thanks. It is at
least in part sarcastic. ‘I know off by heart, says Lesbonicus, all that
you have told me. I want to hear no more of it. And yet Ι (10 thank
you, just so far (‘as much' or ‘as little ’) as you deserve it.’ For proinde
ut see v. 65.

660. at, ‘oh! but.’ Don’t thank me and think to get rid of me—
I cannot let you go thus.

661. parum pudere te, ‘that you are wanting in proper feeling.’
So pudicus, ‘a man of proper feeling,' v. 697.
662. postremo, see v. 613. Distinguish the meaning of auscultare

G. T. 12
