quidem‚vpars1m. Similarly in the middle of a word, nempe,

ξ omnis.

Final s was in much the same case. It was omitted in
verbs before ne interrogative—rogan=rogasne, iuben=iubesne,
uiden=uidesne, &c.¹

But magis, mage, potis, pote (like amaris, amare in the 2nd
sing. pass.) are distinct forms. The longer forms magis and
potis are often written when, before another consonant, position
is neglected and the last syllable scanned short. So nimis, satis,
miniis, prins, maniiS‚ eris, before consonants.

Similarly s with mute consonants does not make position,

, sp, sc, st, quiesce, harflspex, Diespiter—est, adest, potest,

estis—iste, Istic, istuc, ostendO, uenfistate—even with an r
following, magistratus, ministrArQ fenestra.

Greek words with ζ were written in the time of Plautus in
Latin with s or ss. Hence tarpesita (even if we write it with
the MSS. tarpezita).

x was written for cs but position was neglected, ex, exercitus,
senex, fixor.

Δ ps does not necessarily lengthen a preceding vowel, lpse, abs,
abscessi, abstulisti, &c.

Like m, n followed by a consonant need not lengthen its

syllable, tamen, in compounded with verbs, δια, incedere, Tn-

genium, indiligenter, Tnprt'idens. So n is neglected in itan
tandem, uiden scelestus, ἃς.

Nor need a vowel followed by nt be long, whether in 3rd pl.
in verbs, decent, strident, solent, or elsewhere, Intus, interea,
iquntus, So ante once Capt. 243, inde, finde frequently.

r final does not help to make a vowel long by position—nor
always in the middle of a word, ergo, argentum, hercle, ornatus

Hic in all its cases and forms that end in c can be short,
at least when a short monosyllable precedeS, quis haec est, sed
quid hfic, quid hiinc sollicitas.

d and t are neglected in etsi, tametsi, ut, at, ad, id, apud
(indeed apud makes position only with monosyllabic personal
