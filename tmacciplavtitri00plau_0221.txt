sc. 1v.] NOTES. 177

The meaning is explained by the next words, recipe te ad erum. Give
up your useless search and go back.

1027. fugitiuos, ‘ no runaway‚’ δραπέτης. domi, gen. and not loc.
as v. 841. ‘ Domus is declined only according to the second declension
in Plautus and till Sulla.' Commeminit domi, cf. Ter. Eun. 815 domi
ficiquesac uicissim ut memineris.

1028. Stasimus having been, as he considers, robbed, waxes
’ eloquent on the degeneracy of the times. ·

ueteres parsimoniae, ‘the old economies‚' parsimoniae ‘ acts of
thriftiness.’ The sing. is abstract thrift, the plur. is thrift put into
practice, ‘thrifty habits.' See on vv. 36 and 490.

1029. potius is not entirely otiose, ‘would that the old economies
were in more honour here, rather than wicked ways’: potius can
be dispensed with, but its presence accords with the sulness of comic
style.

1030. basilica. facinora, ‘deeds worthy of a king,' ‘right royal
themes.’ He speaks as if he were βασιλεύς, not δοῦλος. Plautus uses
both the adj. basilicus (βασιλικός) and the adv. basilice, Capt. 81 1, Pers.
31, Epid. 56.

1031. more majorum, ‘ as his fathers did before him‚’ ironical, as a
slave in Roman law was nullo patre.

1032. nisi quod lubet, ‘unless it pleases them.' Nisi elliptic‚
‘they care nothing for what is lawsul‚ only (they care for) what pleases
them.' See vv. 233, 439.

1033. ambitio iam more sanctast, ‘sels-secking (‘canvassing')
nowadays is sanctioned by custom.’ He does not say there were no
leges de ambitu, there were such before Plautus' time (see Amph. Prol.
74), but the laws did not stop the practice. And probably these lines
are more applicable to the Athens of Philemon than to the Rome of
Plautus. Cf. v, 28 ff.

1034. scuta lacere fugereque hostis more habent licentiam, ‘ by
custom men have sull freedom to fling away their shields and run from the
foe.’ The infinitives iacere, fugere are objects after habent licentiam.
Petere and praeterire in the next lines are subject infinitives. The persons
alluded to are the ῥιψάσπιδες of Ar. Nub. 353, Pax 1186. Itis much
more likely that some well—known persons, who had received undeserved
promotion, are meant, than that the allusion is a literary allusion to
Archilochus and his abandoned shield (Bergk, frag. 6). Cf. the passage
Epid· 33 —36‚ which Schmieder thinks may refer to C. Terentius Varro,
who brought about the disaster of Cannae.
