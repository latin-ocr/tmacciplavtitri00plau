se. 1.] ΝΟ TES. 9 1

auri is used for ‘jewellery’ generally. flabelliferae, carrying the
peacock’s feathers, which were used as fans—sandaligerulae‚ because
sandals were taken off when the guests took their places at table, and
brought by a slave just before they took their departure. Hence soleas
poscere &c. as Hor. Sat. 11. 8. 77= ‘to prepare to get up and go.’

263. cantrices, probably to sing during the meal ε cistellatrices—
the cistellae contained money and valuables. Girls with cistellae are
very common on painted vases. The plurals are plurals of rhetorical
exaggeration to make the whole number appear as large as possible,
and with the same object the ‘messengers' are comically subdivided
into nuntii, renuntiz', as if there was one set to bear messages and
another set to carry replies.

254. raptores panis et peni, ‘ plunderers of prog and provender‚’
in apposition to the slaves described in the two preceding lines, to
whom also illis v. 2 5 5 a refers.

257. ubi qui eget, quam preti sit parui, ‘ of how little account a
man is when he is poor‚' quz' is indefinite and ubi qui=si quis. Cf.
Pers. 313 nam ubi qui mala tangit manu, dolores coorz'untur, Pseud. 681
bene ubi quoi scimus consilium accidis-se, hominem catum eum esse
declaramus. Preti‘, by the shortening to which words properly iambic
were subject, known as ‘the breuis breuians’ law.

258. apage is the Greek imper. ἄπαγε. In Latin it is really an
exclamation used either absolutely or, as here, with an acc„ apage te,
‘avaunt thee‚’ which is an acc. of exclamation, like the aces. after alc,
o, eu &c.

259. illud, like ἐκεῖνο, of something that is to follow, here the infmi-
tives esse (=edere) et bibere. ‘ Although this is pleasant, I mean feasting
and drinking, still Love brings bitterness enough to vex (the lover).‘
Amor amara are brought together for the assonance. So Vergil plays on
the sound, Ecl. 111. 110. Cf. Cist. 68 ello an amare occipere amarum
est? ibid. 69 Amor et melle et felle est ficundz‘ssz'mus, gustui dat dulce,
amarum ad satietatem usque oggerit.

260 b. satis quod aegre sit. We seem to want, as Leo says, satis
quod <amatori > aegre sit. The lover is the subject to the verbs in the
following lines, and that he should be mentioned here seems indispens-
able. Otherwise the change of subject from amor to amator is a harsh
κατὰ σύνεσιν construction.

261. hig-irat for fugat, Spengel. Cf. Poen. 508 atque equidem
hercle dedita opera amicos fugz'taui senes, and with the whole passage
Truc. 574 (meretrix meum erum) priuabit bonis, luce, honore atque amicis.
