74 TRJNVMMVS. [ACT 1.

120. siqui, ‘if by any means,’ ‘to see whether you could.' qui abl.
of the indefinite pronoun v. 14=el πως. ¹

non uti, ἀνακολούθως, but livelier than the correct quam uti.

122. malo, the more general word instead of the special culpa,
with special reference to V. 99.

123. non istuc meumst, ‘that’s not my way.’ So Asin. ¹90 non
meumst, Pers. 46 hoc meumst, infr. v. 445.

124. quld taces? is interjected parenthetically‚ then, ubi nunc &c.‚
the main sentence is continued, and hasce aedes further defined. So Men.
616 per Iouem deosque omnis adiuro, uxor—satin hoc est tibi 3—me isti
non nutasse, Mil. 801 ille—eiusmodi est—cupiet miser.

127. factum, not sactum est. The rule is that where sactum or the
like stands alone est is omitted, where there is a subject or pronoun est
isinserted, as v. 429 factum z'd quoquest. This is a sentence, sactum is
merely an exclamation. So bene hercle sactum, sactum optume and the
like.

128. edepol nde adulescentem mandatum malae. On the dat.
fide see v. 1 17. The whole line is an acc. of exclamation after edepol, as
often after eu, hercle and the like, e.g. Asin. 580 edepol senem Demae-
netum lepidum fuisse, Epid. 72 eu edepol res turbulentas, ibid. 212 hercle
rem gestam bene, infr. vv. 138 and 592.

129. dedistine=nonne dedisti? The second syllable of dedisti is
scanned short, as also v. 127. Qui here and again vv. 132 and 135 is
instrumental abl. of the rel. There is an allusion to the Greek proverb
μὴ παιδὶ μάχαιραν. 7

130. quid secus est aut quid interest, ‘ what distinction or what
difference is there (between giving a sword and) that you should give '.
&c- The expression is pleonastic, but such pleonasm is a marked feature
αἱ comedy, e.g. vv. 615, 633, 1096. Secus is a neut. nom. sing„ used
also as adv. and prep„ like tenus.

131. amanti nomm adulescenti, anlml impoti, ⁸ a mere stdpling,
in love and not master of himself ἐ homo is used like ἀνήρ ins Greek to·
intensify the meaning of words, good or bad, generally in a pitying or
contemptuous sense, e.g. seruos Ιιοφηοεδοῦλος ἀνήρ, ‘a mere slave,’ or
‘a poor slave.’ Here it goes with adulescens. Impos (the opposite of
compos, and like it foll. by gen.)‚ cf. Cas. 629 suist impos animi.

132. qul exaedificaret, ‘to enable him to complete,’ lit. ‘finish the
building os worthlessness he has begun.' But in v. 1127 exaedfficare
:ex aedibus eicere. With the metaphorical sense in this line cf. Cic. de
