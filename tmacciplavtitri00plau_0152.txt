The Roman stage does not shew interiors. Accordingly all meetings
must take place in the street, i.e. in front of the houses which form the
background of the stage. If A is to meet B, B either meets him in the
street or comes out of his house opportunely just as A arrives. So
Lesbonicus and Stasimus come out opportunely here, and Philto's words
serve to introduce them to the spectators.

SCENE 4 (402—601). Philto, standing aside, overhears the con-
versation between Lesbonicus and his slave Stasimus. He learns that
the house has been sold and the money spent. He shews himself,
v. 432, and asks in his son's name for the hand of Lesbonicus’ sister.
Lesbonicus, despite all the efforts of Stasimus, refuses to betroth his
sister without a dowry. He has one sarm left, he will give her that.
Stasimus, in terror that their last possession will go, draws Philto aside
and tells him that the sarm is fatal to its possessors, and that Lesbonicus
only wants to get rid of it. Philto is impressed, returns to Lesbonicus

and makes the betrothal, leaving the bride’s brother and the bridegroom
to settle the matter of the farm.

The scene in B is marked DV, i.e. diueffiium, dialogue. The metre
throughout is Iambic Trimeters.
