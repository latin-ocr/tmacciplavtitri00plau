and stood upon his head in the road.’ A slave had to make way for a
manos free birth in the street.

482. de honore populi, ‘a public office,' as if a poor slave like
Stasimus were eligible sor such, either in Athens or Rome!

483. non hercle hoe longe, ‘saith I will withdraw not this much.’
Hoc δεικτικῶς, accompanied by an expressive gesture. So tantillum,
v. 60.

484. cena. hac annonast sine saeris hereditas, ‘a supper, when
things are so dear, is an inheritance without any drawbacks.' Hac
annona, ‘with the present high prices‚' ‘in the present dearth‚' the
opposite of Mil. 3²1 tam uili tritico, ‘when corn is so cheap.’ The
sacra domestica or gentilicia were expensive to keep up, and the in·
heritance was seriously diminished if the successor was under obligation
to maintain them. Hence sine sacris hereditas became proverbial sor
an unexpected and unimpaired slice of luck, e.g. Capt. 775 sine sacris
hereditatem sum aptus effertzksumam.

486. 111 optumum esse, tute uti sis optumus. Here uti (ut) follows
optumum est, as Aul. 582 nunc lzoc mihi factust optumum, ut te lzz'nc
auferam, and as it does melius est (Rud. 220), and elsewhere par est,
iustum est, consentaneum est, &c-

488. condicionem, ‘proposal of marriage, ’as before.

489. dare, ‘to grantss refers to peto, accipere to fero, so that the
arrangement of the words makes a chiasmus.

490. dei diuites sunt, deos decent opulentiae, ‘the gods only have
gold, with the gods only displays of wealth and means go well-⁹ Dei,
deos, scanned as monosyllables by the regular synizesis. Notice the
alliteration—see v. 27—and the plur. of the abstract noun opulentia,
‘ wealth,' used as the plur. of abstract nouns so often is in Plautus, in the
sense ‘displays of wealth. ’ See on v. 36.

491. uerum nos homunculi, salinum animae qui quom extemplo
emisimus, ‘but we poor mortals‚ as soon as ever we have surrendered up
our little span of life.‘ The antithesis is between dei, who alone are really
diuites, and nos homunculi, where the diminutive is pitying and con·
temptuous, ‘ poor mortals.' But the sentence is a slight anacolouthon.
It ought to continue with the verb in the first pers. plur. censu censemur
omnes aequo or the like, in place of which there are new subjects mendi-
cus and opulentissimus, subdivisions of nos homunculi, followed by the
verb censetur in the third pers.

492. salinum is the reading os BCD. The word occurs besides only
Catull. 23, 19 where it is used literally‚ ‘a salt-cellar! It is possible
