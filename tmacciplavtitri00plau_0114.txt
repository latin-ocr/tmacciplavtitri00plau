70 TRIN VMM VS. [Ac‘r 1.

78. adcurare: the verb is exclusively comic‚ the part. adj. accuratus
and the adV. are classical.

79. segregent. So Asin. 774 suspiciones omnis ab se segreget. Se,
‘by itself,' as an adv.=‘apart,' makes sed-itio, ‘a going apart,' sedulo
(se-dolo), securus, secerno, soluo (se-luo), also the legal phrase se fraude,
‘without harm.'

80. qua-propter and propterea. Cf. ad-eo and quo-ad. Qua and
ea are abl. sing. fem. as posteo, praeterea, antea, eadem, haud-quaquam,
qua-tenus, &c-

81. ego meo sum promus pectori, ⁴ I am butler to my own bosom.’
promus or cellarius was the slave who had charge os the wine-cellar and
the larder. He took out provisions (promere) when wanted and stored
them safely away (condere). Cf. Mil. 837 bono subpromo et promo cellam
creditam, Pseud. 608 condus promus sum, procurator peni. Callicles
says in effect that he has the key of his own breast and can lock out
blame, he has not the key of other people's breasts to lock out suspicion.
Pectort‘ is a dat. (commodi) freely used in comedy where we might expect
the gen. Cf. vv. 126, 131, 177, 204. Pectus, cor, the seat of the intellect
as well as the affections. So v. 82, Epid. 385.

83. nam, to introduce a particular illustration of the principle
just laid down. The crime here imagined was proverbial for a daring
sacrilege. Cf. Men. 941 at ego te sacram coronam surrupuisse Ioui
scio.

surrupuisse, from rapio. Cf. u in compounds sor a in contubernium,
percutio, conculco, exsulto, insulsus, ἃς.

85. columine=culmine. So Amph. 367 audaciai columen, Cas.
535 senati columen. Plautus never has the sorm culmen. On the top
of the pediment of the temple Jupiter was represented as triumphator,
crowned with a laurel-wreath and in a quadriga. The statue and the
terracotta quadriga were modelled by Turianus‚ an Etruscan sculptor
from Fregenae. See on the Temple of Jupiter Capitolinus generally
Middleton's Ancient Rome, p. 227 ff.

86. suspicax-ier. The form suspicax-ier has never been satisfactorily
explained. The ordinary infin. pass. and depon. in i is originally dat.
(=indogerm. *aff e.g. agi, dici, sequi διο. The longer form agi-er,
dici-er, laudari-er, is found contemporaneously‚ but not earlier. Stolz
(Miiller, Hdb. 11². 380) would explain these as formed from the usual
infinitive in i with the infinitive-suffix -ere borrowed from the thematic

verb. The shortening -er from ·ere he illustrates by biber (Titinius) and -

haber (Corp. Inscr. Lat. 8. 8369).
