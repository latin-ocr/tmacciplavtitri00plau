that Stasimus, as κριτής, will fine him. But the reading is uncertain.
B has curis, CD turis. Merula corrects etiam ob stultitiam tuam te
tueris? multabo mina, ‘do you actually defend yourself for your stu-
pidity? I will fine you a mina,' tue'ris being from tuor, the third conjug.
form of tueor. But te is the objectos multabo, any rebellion on Les-
bonicus’ part against the award of Stasimus has been confined to look
or gesture, and the simple verb tueris is not very probable; contuor,
intuor, obtuor are the compounds in use. Niemeyer suggests ted auri
multabo mina, which gives good sense, but keeping closer to the MSS.
reading, 1 propose te iuris multabo mina, ‘1 will fine you the legal
penalty of a mina,’ iuris mina=iy τῶν νόμων μνᾶ. Ladewig and Ritschl
reject vv. 707, 708, but objection to them vanishes if the allusion is to
some Greek system of fining bad actors. Roman actors were not fined
till a later period (Tac. A. Ι. 17). In Plautus’ time, as slaves, they were

’ beaten if they acted badly, see v. 990 and the close of the Cistellaria, v.

784, ornamenta ponent (‘take off their costumes’). postidea loci, qui
deliquit uapulabit‚ qui non deliquit bibet. And so the close of the
Asinaria, v. 946 nunc si uoltis deprecari lzuic seni (i.e. the actor who
has played the old man’s part) ne uapulet &c.

709. quid. tibi interpellatio aut in' consilium huc accessiost. ἰ
Lesbonicus is angry at the intervention of Stasimus, all the more so as
he has gone against his master. So he testily asks him ‘what business
he has to interfere? ' By quid Lesbonicus means cur. But the imper-
turbable Stasimus answers as if he had meant quo modo. Perhaps we
may say, ⁴ how came you to interfere’ ἃς.

Quid tibi interpellatio est? is a well-known Plautine idiom by which,
in this question quid tibi (uobis)...est only, the verbal substantive govems
the same case as the verb itself, e.g. Amph. 5¹9 quid tibi hanc curatiost
rem aut muttitio ? Asin. 920 quid tibi hunc receptio ad test meum uirum?
Aul. 744 quid tibi ergo meam me inuito tactiost? Men. 1016 quid me uobis
tactiost? Poen. 1308 quid tibi lianc digito tactiost? Rud. 502 quid mihi
scelesto tibi erat auscultatio ? Truc. 2 59 quid tibi ad hasce accessio aedis
est prope aut pultatio ἒ

710. eodem pacto quo huc accessi apscessero. As if Lesbonicus
wanted to know how, not why, he interfered‚ Stasimus pertly answers,
‘I will retire in the same way as I approached.' The logical answer
would be, ‘ Ι came in the same way as I will go‚’ but the form is altered
because Stasimus withdraws a few steps as he speaks. Eodem pacto
z: pedibus.

⁰113. aequom censeo. See vv. 392 and 448.
