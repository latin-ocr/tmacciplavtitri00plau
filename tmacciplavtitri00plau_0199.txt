sc. 1.] NOTES. 155

828. atque &c., ‘and yet with my ears this was the report of you
Ι had before heard—'tis well known among men.' The last clause is
parenthetical, gloriam is explained by v. 829. Auribus is not otiose
but points the contrast opera expertus )( auribus acceperam.

829. diuites damnare atque domare, as a judge passing sentence
on them and humbling their pride. Charmides was returning rich,
therefore if Neptune had been true to his reputation he could not hope
for mercy. But he found the reputation was not true, and therefore
praises Neptune.

The fragment that follows v. 830 has no place here, for Charmides is
not poor or a beggar, ‘ mendicis cur se adnumeret nulla causa.’

830. abl, laudo, ‘get along, 1 praise you.’ Abi is usually an ex-
pression of dissatisfaction and blame, as Mil. ‘29¹ abi, non uerisimile

. dicis, ‘comel corne! what you say is improbable,' ibid. 324 abi, ludis me,

‘comel come! you're making fun of me.' But in places abi is ‘uerbum
cum laudatione blandientz‘s,’ as Asin. 704 em sic: abi, laudo, Ter. Ad.
564 laudo, Ctesz'plw, patrissas: abi, uirum te iudico, where Donatus
explains, quasi disat, ‘non est cur te morer!

ordine, ut aequomst, ‘you know how to treat people according to
their station, as is right.' That is to say, you do not diuites damnas
atque domas, but treat each with the respect that is his due. Scis
tractare, like Pers. 762 beneficium scit accz'Jbere et reddere nescit.

832. fidus fuisti: infidum esse iterant. These are contrasted
clauses,-see on v. 292—‘you have been faithful (to me), though people
declare that you are faithless.'

apsque foret te, ‘had it not been for you.' Absque is used by
Plautus and Terence so as to imply a conditional clause=si sine te, and
the verb esset or foret is impersonal, so that absque te foret: si tu non
esses. So Bacch. 412, Capt. 754, Men. 1022, Pers. 836 διο. Absque
is revived by Silver-age writers and used without a verb, so that absque
me=sine me.

833. disque tunssentzdzstulztssentque, the prep. is separated from
its verb by tmesis, as in ob uos sacr0=0bsecr0 uos. This is a feature of
the older stage of every language. See Lindsay, L. L. p. 573, who
quotes ‘sub uos placo,' the archaic phrase for supplico retained in Latin
prayers; transque dato and endoque plorato, legal archaisms for traditoque
and imploratoque.

satellites. Neptune's ‘myrmidons' or ‘ministering spirits’ are the
winds and storms. Sate‘llile‘s, the first shortening like sagittas v. 72 5,
the second like turbines v, 835.
