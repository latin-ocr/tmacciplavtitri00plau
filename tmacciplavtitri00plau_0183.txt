it, when you can get it you don’t care for it.‘ The second person is
‘ generalising‚’ not ‘ you in particular‚' but ‘ anyone.' cupias...uelis,
potential.

672. me qm expauit, διε. The line is perfectly Plautine in structure
and phraseology. But it must be condemned as a gloss or an imitation
of v. 670. Perhaps uetat, not uocat, is a trace of later origin. Aspellere
:abs-pellere is a good Plautine word, peculiar to comic diction.

673. insanum malumst hospitio deuerti ad cupidinem, ‘it is a
desperately bad thing to turn in and put up at ‘the Cupid.’ Cupid is
compared to an inn (deuersorium, taberna deuersoria), in which it is
dangerous to seek shelter. Cupido is a stronger term than amor. Thus
Nonius, p. 421 cupido est inconsideratae necessitatis, amor iudicii, Servius
on Verg. Aen. VI. 194 cupidinem ueteres immoderatum amorem dicebant.
Insanum is used as an adverb, as it is Bacch. 761 insanum magnum
molior negotium, Most. 908 porticum insanum bonam, ‘awfully good,’
Mil. 24 estur insanum bene,‘ is awfully good eating. ’ Plautus does not
use the regular adv. insane.

675. si istuc conare ut facis indicium, ‘if you attempt your plan,
as you declare you will, you will have your family m a blaze. ' The
Α reading is doubtful, and the text given is a transposition of the MSS.
si istuc ut conare facis indicium. The last word very possibly is not
right, but the emendation often accepted incendio incendes genus, is not
satisfactory if only because tuom is badly wanted, and Bergk‘s improve-
ment igni tuom incendes genus loses all the point of incendio incendes,
and does not account for the MSS. reading, unless it be igni—incendio—
indicium, a not very likely process. The general sense is clear enough.
Your plan will set fire to your family, then you will shout for water and
probably put the house out altogether, i.e. if you part with the land, you
*will be in great danger of utter want, then lover-like, you will fly to a
desperate remedy and enlist; the end will be the extinction of your line.
We may suppose that Philemon had οἶκος, not γένος, when the figure
of first fire and then water becomes much more natural. But the fire is
first destructive, v, 675, then necessary for the maintenance of the house
or family, v. 678. The water is meant to save, v. 676, but it destroys‚
v. 678. However, perhaps this is due to the excessive use. Lover-like,

Lesbonicus flies from extreme to extreme, and never thinks of the happy
mean, the ideal of Greek philosophy. See sor a discussion of the passage
Langen, Plaut. Stud„ p. 82.

676. tum igitur and igitur tum are apparently used indifferently
by Plautus, like Homer's δὴ τότε for τότε δή. E.g. Most. 689 igilur
