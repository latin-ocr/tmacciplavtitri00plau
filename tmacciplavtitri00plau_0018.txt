—the Bacchides—is to be explained by the fact that an
allusion in the Bacchides shews it to be a later play than the
Epidicus, hence it is placed after the Epidicus in the list. N eed-
less to say these do not all possess the same merit, and are not
to be ranked in the same class. Brix calls six (Aulularia,
Captiui, Bacchides, Menaechmi, Pseudolus, Trinummus) first-
rate—but there is much to be said against the exclusion of
several others, e.g. Mostellaria and Miles, from the highest rank.
The text of all has not reached us quite complete. There are
gaps—greater 01· less—in Amphitruo, Cistellaria, Stichus—the
beginning of the Bacchides and the end of the Aulularia are
lost: the Casina and the Truculentus have suffered the worst
corruptions; others, Epidicus, Mercator, Persa, Stichus, are
supposed to shew signs of a double recension. The plays are
not merely amusing; though Plautus is no moralist, the moral
is combined with the comic element, and the Captiui and
Trinummus for example handle fine psychological problems.
What then must have been the influence of a great poet, who
wrote perhaps 40 plays, and whose writing extended over some
40 years, upon the good humour and good sense of Rome?
Great Roman authorities like Varro and Cicero have placed
Plautus very high. Horace alone (A. P. 270, Epist. 11. 1. 170)
expresses himself unfavourably about Plautini numeri and sales,
and this unfavourable verdict is to a great extent to be explained
by the wide difference between the Prosody and Metre of the
two writers.

The originals of Plautus were the Attic writers of the N ew
Comedy. The Trinummus was based upon the Θησαυρός of
Philemon, the Mostellaria upon his Φάσμα. From the Ἐμπορος
of Philemon came the Mercator, from his Κληροῦμενοι the
Casina. The Rudens is drawn from a play of Diphilus, the
Asinaria from the Ὀναγός of Demophilus. From the great poet
of the New Comedy, Menander, come the Bacchides (Δὶς
ἐξαπατῶν), Poenulus (Καρχηδόνιος) and Cistellaria. It must not
be supposed that in any case Plautus merely translated. The
phrase ‘Latine uertit Maccz'us’ of the Prologues means ‘gave
the play its Latin dress'; the version was very free, the poet did
