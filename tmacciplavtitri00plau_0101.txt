NOTES.

Argmnentum. The metrical summaries of the contents of the
Plautine plays are of two sorts, acrostich and non-acrostich. We have
the acrostich arguments of ῃ all the plays except the Bacchides. The non-
acrostich arguments survive to five plays only (Amph. Aul. Mil. Merc-
Pseud.). They are of 15 lines each, except that to the Amphitruo‚'
which is of 10.

The acrostichs are the earlier and the better in knowledge of Plautine
usage and versification. They are considered to belong to the best
period of Plautine studies in the 7th cent. A.1J.C., the date to which the
⁴Prologues belong, and may on the suggestion of F. Osann be ascribed
to Aurelius Opilius (84 B-C.)‚ who is mentioned by Gellius 111. 3. 1 as
the author of ‘indices' on Plautus.

The non-acrostichs are later and rougher. They may be ascribed to
the grammarian C. Sulpicius Apollinaris of Carthage (150 A.D.), who
wrote the arguments to the books of the Aeneid and to Terence.

1. Thensaurum, the ‘treasure' from which Philemon's play wa
named. For the spelling Τ immaurus: θησαυρός cf. Scaptensula:
Σκαπτὴ ὕλη or Σκαπτησύλη, ΟᾶενεοηεηεαςεΧερσόνησος, Megalensia:
-Μεγαλήσιω The n appears in these words not so much to represent η
as to come from the tendeney which gives such misspellings as occansio
for occasio. See Lindsay‚ Latin Language pp. 69 and 136.

The last syllable of abstrusum is not elided, i.e. there is hiatus in
caesura.

3. ῦΠιιετ-Ᾱεεόοηίεω.

4. et, ‘ even.’ This sense of et=etiam is not Plautine·

5. poscitur, ‘Lesbonicus’ sister is asked in marriage without a
dowry.' Cf. v. 384.
6. minus quo cum inuidia=ut cum minore inuidia.
