1 60 TRIN VMM VS. [Ac‘r Ν.

agitandae sunt uigiliae, but if the verb does not take an acc. imperandum
est seruis &c. as in the early period. See Roby, L. G. 11. p. lxi. ff„
Madvig, L. G. 421. τ’).

870. aperite hoc, ‘open here! With hoc supply ostium, as v.
1 174, Pseud. 1 139 ecquis hoc aperit? Rud. 413 ecquis hoc recludit? &c.

tutelam gerit? So Truc. 2 5 5 ecquis huic tutelam gerit ianuae? and
more simply Men. 673 heus, ecquis Jzic est ianitor? When the Syco-
phant knocks at the door, Charmides shews himself and questions him.

871. istas, sc.s0res from fhribus above.

872. census quom sum, iuratori reete rationem dedi, ‘when 1
was assessed, 1 made a correct return to the assessor.’ The Sycophant
is annoyed at the questions suddenly sprung upon him. He says in
effect that he is a free citizen and he has answered all questions to those
who were entitled to ask them. Nevertheless he does explain his busi-
ness. Iuratores, assistants of the censor in taking the census of citizens.
Cf. Poen. Prol. 55 ff. nunc rationes ceteras Ι αεεζρἰεῐ nam argumentum
lzoc lzic censebitur ..uos iuratores estis.

873. hic belongs rather to in his regionibus ubi habitet than to
quaero. Cf. Mil. 1258 nescio ubi hic prope adest, ‘somewhere or other
here‚’ and ubi lzz‘c ‘whereabouts here‚' frequently.

8¹14. ad. istanc capitis albitudinem, ‘ approximating to your white-
ness of head‚' ‘about as white-headed as you are.’ Ad: ‘approximating
to' as Merc. 427 (ancillam) ad istam faciem, hence its use like παρά
and πρός in the sense ‘in comparison with,' as v. 723, and in statements
of number, amount Sec. as v. 152.

878. mace, as nom. plur., a form expressly attested by Priscian, is
like the nom. plur. eis due to the addition of the plur. suffix sto the
already formed plur. hei, hi, i. e. these plurals were formed on the
analogy of I-stems. The form occurs before vowels Mil. 374 and 1334,
Pers. 856, Pseud. 539, Rud. 294 &c., and in a number of inscriptions
from Capua (C. I. L. 1. 565—569) which give heisce magistr-ei and
heisce magistreis as nom. plur. See Muner, Handbuch 11². p. 333 and
cf. the dat. plur. hibus (Cure. 506) and z‘bus (Mil. 74).

pater is a respectful address of an old man by a young one, as mater
of an old woman by a young woman. Hence Hor. Epist. 1. 6. 54
frater, pater adde.

880, expediam, ‘explain.’

881. unum quidquidzunum quidque, for quidquid is common in
old Latin, and found occasionally up to Cicero’s time without relative
force. See Madvig on Cic. de F in. v. 9. 24.
