1 28 TRIN VMM VS. [Aer 11.

584. qum opus sit facto, ‘tell him to consider what must be done
about the dowry.’ This is the regular construction, viz. the part. in the
abl. with quid or other neut. pron. (id, quod, &c.). The part. is instru-
mental abl. after opus (or usus), and quid is either acc. or, perhaps more
probably, nom„ in apposition to opus facto, which is equivalent to an
adj. The person concerned, if expressed, is in the dat. Cf. v. 807,
Amph. 505 citius quod non facto est usus fit, quam quodfizcto est opus,
ibid. 628 nam mi istuc primum exquisito est opus, Cist. 129 quod
tacito usus est, Merc. 565 quod opust facto facito ut cogites, Cic. Fam.
VI 1 1. 8. 5 si quid de ea re ad populum ad plebemue lato opus esset.

· 585. certumst, vv. 270 and 511.
dare, ‘to give her‚’ i.q. dare nuptum. Dare takes the place of an

iambus, i.e. -re is what is known as syllaba anceps, which is allowed
under the same conditions as hiatus, viz. where there is a decided pause
or a change of speaker.

586. neque enim 1111 damno umquam esse patiar. The sentence
is interrupted by Stasimus’ abi modo. Meam negligentiam is acc. before
esse, and the order is neque enim umquam patiar meam negligentiam illi
damno esse. Damno is predicative dat„ as it is Asin. 571, Bacch. 1103,
Cist. 50—other examples Roby, L. G. 11. p. xlv. To preserve the arrange-
ment translate ‘ I will assuredly never allow my sister to suffer...from
my carelessness.’ Enim is an asseverative particle, see note on v. 61.

587. neque enim. Here again the sequence of the sentence is
broken by Stasimus with his impatient I modo. lVeque enim...opsit is one
sentence twice thus interrupted. ‘ Nor assuredly...d0es it seem fair that
my misdeeds should not...damage myself rather than anyone else.' The
end of the line is defective in the MSS.‚ which have Ο pater, a copyist's
mistake from two lines lower down. Neque enim...i modo is Ussing’s
conjecture, which I prefer to Ritschl’s L. nullo modo adopted by most
editors. With these interrupted sentences cf. Shaks. Temp.‚ 11. i. 143 ff.

590. enumquam, ‘ shall I ever ?’ Enumquam is⁴ best written as a
single word. Zn (Gk. ἥν) is used in Comedy only in rhetorical questions.
Cf. Men. 143 dic mi, enumquam tu uidisti tabulam pictam? δια, ibid.
925 dic mihi .· enumquam intestina tibi crepant, quod sentias? Rud. 987
and 1 1 17. Exit Lesbonicus, still pursued by Stasimus' i modo.

591. tandem impeti-aui abiret, ‘at last I've got him to g0.’ Not
impetraui ut abiret. Cf. v. 681 dem suades, Asin. 644 istud facias ipw,
quod-faciamus nobis suades, Amph. 257 uelatis manibus orant ignoscamus
peccatum suom, Rud. 681 quae uis uim mi afferam ilbsa adigit. On the
use of tandem in Plautus see Langen, Beitrage p. 88 ff.
