60 TRIN VMM VS. [PROL.

the o is not elided. If elision is to take place, the two words intro and
ire are written separately. So circumire and circum ire, &c.

11. accipite, ‘listen,’ ‘let me tell you.' And so often date: ‘tell
me.’

nucinas, ‘empty,' ⁴ disengaged,' the archaic form of the later uacuas
used by Plautus. Cf. Pseud. 469 fac sis uocz'uas aedis aurium ; uocatio
for uacatio, notare for natare in vulgar Latin, and Cas. 527, where
Plautus puns on uocare and uacare. See Munro's note on Lucr. 1.
520.

12. adulescens=Lesb0nicus. Hisce, hosce, hasce before a vowel, Izi,
his, hos, leas before a consonant.

13. me adiutrice, i.e. meo auxilio, ‘ by my help.’

14. quoniam, i.e. quom iam, ‘ now that’= postquam, i.e. it is used
by Plautus in a temporal sense. Cf. vv. 1 12 and 149.

qui is the old abl. (instr.) of the relative, the interrogative, and the
indefinite pronoun, used of all genders (e-g. it is fem. in v. 15), and
sometimes of both numbers. Here it is abl. of the rel.=‘whereby‚'
‘by means of which he could support me.’ The imperf. subj. aleret
follows the historic pres. uideo, because this is virtually the same as uidi.
Cf. Bacch. 290 quoniam sentio quae res gereretur, nauem extemplo statu-
imus.

relicui, part. gen. after nil, ‘ nothing of a balance ’=‘ nothing left 'z
relicuus in Plautus is always quadrisyllabic.

15. exigat, pres. subj. after the past tense dedi, a sequence not
uncommon in Plautus where the purpose is future, the result represented
as still continuing‚ and found sometimes where this is not the case. Cf.
Amph. 195 me a portu praemisit domum, ut haec nuntiem, Bacch. 352
ita fici, ut auri quantum uellet sumeret, Epid. 444 non repperisti,
adulescens, tranquillum locum, ubi tuas uirtutes explices, ibid. 570
exciuisti. . .ut uideas, Mil. 13 1 dedi mercatori quoidam, qui ad illum deferat,
Pseud. 795 Orcus recipere ad se hunc noluit, ut esset lzic qui mortuis
cenam coquat. It is hardly too much to say that the strict sequence of
tenses did not exist in colloquial Latin, but that the tense is decided by
the point of view which 1s at the base of each individual sentence. See
also Sonnenschein' s note on Rud.127 ff. On quicum see v. 905.

16. sed, abruptly breaking off and changing the subject. Cf. vv.
66, 151, 400

The argument (ὑπόθεσις) was generally explained in the Prologue.
T hat the spectators may not wonder why this is not done here, they are
told that the explanation will be given in the play itself, by the old men
