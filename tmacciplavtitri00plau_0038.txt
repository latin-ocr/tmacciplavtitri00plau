xxxiv INTRODUCTJON.

not to be pressed to make ‘speaking names,' i.e. names which
express the bearer’s character, unless it be in the cases of the
virtuous Lysiteles (λυσιτελεῖν) and the resolute Stasimus who
will stick to his point.

The scene represents as usual the fronts of houses in the
background with an open street in front. The houses are
those of Callicles, which he has bought from Lesbonicus, and
Megaronides. Between the houses is a space or lane (angi-

portum), and in this space and in the street in front of the
houses the action of the play takes place.

Right and left of the stage is an entrance. That on the
right of the spectators leads to the Forum, that on the left to
the Harbour. Thus persons coming from the city enter from the
right, persons returning from foreign parts come in on the left.

Five actors would be required to fill the roles of this play,
viz. (1) Lesbonicus, (2) Lysiteles—one of these could undertake
the part of the Sycophant, (3) Callicles and Philto, (4) Charmides
and Megaronides, (5) Stasimus. The wigs worn by the actors
shewed the kind of character they represented. Old men wore
white wigs and used sticks‚ young men black wigs, slaves red
wigs. Charmides is dressed as a traveller, the Sycophant
disguised as a foreigner.

The play has deservedly been a favourite, and has often
been imitated since the revival of letters. Thus it has been
the model of the Italian ‘La dote' of J. M. Cecchi‚ of the
French ‘Le tresor cache' of Destouches‚ and of the German
‘Der Schatz⁷ of Lessing.
