1130. nam beneficium homini proprium quod datur, pro suo
sumpserit, ‘a benefit which is given a man for himself (proprium), you
will find he will spend as his own property.' MSS. presumpserit, pro
suo sumpserit Ussing; sumpserit, ‘spend,’ as v. 414. Boxhorn’s con·
jectum, prosum or prorsum perit, is generally adopted, but ‘quis sanus
dixit beneficium, quod datur, prorsum perire?’

1131. quod datur utendum, id repetundi copiast, quando uelis,
‘what is only lent, one can ask back, when desired.' Callicles says
‘the treasure was not given me, therefore Ι had no right to spend it3
it was only lent me, therefore Ῑ deserve no particular credit for restoring
it on demand from the rightful owner.' Strictly speaking, the trust of
the treasure was a deposit, not a loan, but under the head of a loan
it is distinguished from a free gift. Dono dare: proprium dare, ‘to give ’
)( dare utendum, ‘to lend‚’ as Men. 657 sed ego illam non condonaui,
sed sic utendam dedi. Leo rejects the couplet, 1 think on inadequate
grounds.

1133. eum sororem despondisse suam in tam fortem tammam,
‘that Lesbonicus has betrothed his sister into so wealthy a household.’
Nonius, p. 306, explains sortem as diuitem et copiosam. Despondisse in,
see v, 605. ,

1134. enim, ‘indeed‚' ‘why to be sure.' See v· 705.

1135. occupauit, ‘he has secured,’ ‘gained a footing in.’ Nonius,
p. 355, occupare est etiam inuenire, tenere uel possidere.

1136. sed maneam etiam, opinor, ‘but let me wait still, I think ²
=‘ but I think I had better waita little longer.’ Maneam is coniunctium
adhortatiuus, 1st pers. sing„ according to the Greek use, as Most. 849
mane sis uideam, Pers. 542 uideam modo, Ter. Phorm. 140 adeam, credo.

commodum, as v. 400.

1137. uali, ‘bah’ or ‘bother,' an exclamation of vexation at his
forgetfulness.

mule nummum aureum, ‘a thousand of gold pieces' ; see on vv. 152
and 425.

1141. quem...eum‚ ‘whom I did not know, nor have Ι ever seen
him! Both Greek and Latin dislike keeping up a succession of relativa,
and when they have commenced with a relative, lapse in the next clause
into the demonstrative, as Capt. 555 quibus insputari saluti ficit atque
fs profuit.
