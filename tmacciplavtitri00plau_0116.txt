status condictus cum lzoste (‘stranger') intercedit dies. Hostis, Germ.
gast, our ‘guest‚’ keeps its meaning in the derivatives hostel, osteria,
holel.

comedis is an optative subjunctive form, on which see v. 6. Cicero
(Fam. ΙΧ. 20) has comedim and (de F in. 11. 7. 22) edint. Another of
these forms duint occurs v. 436.

103. is, i.e. iis. Cf. v. 17.

104. est atque non est mim in manu, ‘it is and yet it is not in my
power,' ⁴ within my control.' Cf. Amph. 564 istuc tibist in manu, Rud.
983 in manu non est mea. Like so many colloquial phrases this is
found in Cicero's Letters, e.g. Fam. xlv. 2. 3.

105. ut ne, consecutive, like Mil. 149 faciemus ut, quod uiderit, ne
uiderit, Most. 1053 pergunt turbare usque, ut ne quid possit conquiescere.

107. rem, ‘the facts of the case‚’ which he proceeds to tell. So
Epid. 713 iam res ipsa dicet tibi, Aul. 421 res ipsa testist. In the next
line rem: rem familiarem, ‘the estate,' ‘ property. ’

auctorem, legal, ‘ surety‚’ ‘guarantee‚' used in apposition to the fem.
rem, as in Stich. 129 a woman says auctores sumus, and Verg. of a
woman auctor ego audendi.

108. filius=Lesbonicus.

109. prostratum, ‘ flung down,’ a strong expression but effective of
an uncared sor and neglected state. Cf. Cic. Cluent. 6 perfregit ac
prostrauit omnia cupiditate ac furore. prostratum Bergk, B gives
prostractum whence protractum is sometimes read.

110. adultam. So that she ought to have a dowry and be married.

111. simul eius matrem suamque uxorem mortuam, ‘sees too
that the girl's mother and his wife is dead! ‘The girl's mother and his
wife’ are of course one and the same person. In English ‘the girl’s
mother‚' ‘ his wife ’ would be said in apposition without an ‘and.' But
Latin osten uses the copula in such descriptions‚ e.g. capt. 470 ridiculos
inopesque ab se segregat=eos qui ridiculi et inopes sunt, Bacch. 647 regias
copias aureasque optuli, and so in Greek, Eur. Iph. Aul. 1454 πατέρα
τὸν ἀμὸν μὴ στύγει πόσιν τε σόν.

112. quoniam iturust. See on v. 14. The construction begun in
the hist. pres. uidet is continued.

ipsus is a by-sorm of ipse (*ip(e)sc>‘). Ipse is not a development of
ipsus: the two are separate forms, ip5e for -so‘, ipsus for -.ςό.ς. See Lindsay,
L. L. p. 441. Ipsus is the form used by the comedians before a reflexive,
e.g. ipsus sibi.

Seleuciam. 1f the town is meant, we have the same shortening of
