contrastin'g them, by elevating subordinate into independent
characters, by pourtraying the fortunes of the servants no less
than those of their masters, and so forth. Thus we are coming
to the Shaksperian conception of plot—‘ the weaving of distinct
stories into one common dramatic pattern.' See on this Mr
R. G. Moulton's Ancient Classical Drama, on which the above
notes are mainly based.

10. T lte T rz'nummuS. (1) The Trinummus is based upon
the Θησαυρός of Philemon (c. 330—262 B. C.), perhaps the greatest
Athenian favourite among the poets of the New Attic Comedy.

Plautus is fond of Philemon as a model. The Mercator
is drawn from Philemon's Ἔμπορος, the Mostellaria from his
Φάσμα, the Casina from his Κληρούμενοι.

But in this as in other plays it would be a great mistake to
regard Plautus as a mere translator. The only fragment of
the Θησαυρός cited by Athenaeus (IX. 385 e> οὐκ ἔστ’ ἀληθὲς
παραλογίζεσθ’ οὐδ’ ἔχειν ὀψάρια χρηστά cannot be traced with
any probability in the Trinummus.

The Latin name of the play is taken from the coins given
to the Sharper (Sycophanta) for his services v. 843. The title
does not throw any light upon the contents of the play or the
nature of the story, but is borrowed from a chance incident that
has little bearing upon the main facts. A similar case is the
Rudens, where the play is named from the cable with which the
trunk is dragged ashore. There the original was the ,Πήρα of
Diphilus, and the natural name Vidularia was out of the
question because already appropriated to another play of similar
plot. It may be conjectured that the same thing has happened
here, i.e. that the obvious name Thensaurus could not be used
by Plautus because it had already been attached to another
play. .
The story briefiy is this. An Athenian citizen Charmides
resolves to go abroad and trade, to better his fortunes impaired
by his son’s extravagance. He entrusts his property, his son
Lesbonicus and his daughter, to the safe-keeping of his old
friend Callicles. Lesbonicus is a profligate, he⁴ wastes the
property and is finally obliged to sell even the house. „In the
