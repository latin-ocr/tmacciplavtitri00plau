sc. ιιι] NOTES. 147

detraxe, sigmatic aorist form=perf. infin. See on ν. 188. Other
corresponding forms are aduexe, illexe, despexe, circumspexe‚ adduxe,
produxe (Ter. Ad. 561), surrexe (Hor. S. 1. 9. 73). et, where sed
might be expected, after the negative neque, as Amph. 573 uerum hau
mentior, resque uti facta dico, ‘ but Ι am telling you, &c.'

744. Charmidi, gen. of the Greek name Charmides, the regular
form in Plautus. So Achilli (Bacch. 938), Euripidi (Rud. 86), Herculi
(Rud. 822), Philocrati (Capt. 528).

⁷46. atque ea condicio huic uel primm-iant, ‘ and yet this is quite a
first-rate match for her.' Atque, ‘ and yet‚' as v. 910. Vel as a simple
intensive is not common in Plautus.

74⁷. nain, like namque v, 731.

⁷48. utibile magis atque in rem, ‘ more expedient and advan-

> tageous.’ For in rem see ν. 238. Hoc is explained by ut in the next

line, viz. ‘that Ι should go, &c.’

750. sed nunc ego. This is the reading of A, and seems to be
perfectly satisfactory. ‘ But am I now to disclose the existence of the
treasure Ρ ’ Nunc, at this time of day, when I have kept the secret from
him so long. Callicles suggests a plan, only to dismiss it. Megaronides
has done the same ν. 738.

752. minume, minume hercle uero, ‘certainly not, certainly not
indeed.’ But Spengel and Ussing are very likely right in dividing these
words—ME. minume. CA. minume hercle uero, διο. Minume, more
common than minumum, though there are superl. advs. in -um‚ as
potissumum, and many positive advs„ commodum, insanum, διε.

753. locum...comeder1t, a humorous exaggeration like v. 424·

754. quem, i.e. locum ubi thensaurus situs est. Fodere locum like
fodere hortum Poen. 1020.

755. neu=et ne. Cf. Pseud. 322 ne illam uendas neu me perdas
hominem amantem, where as here the second result is contingent on the
first. The whole sentence is dependent on the ‘ if ' clause. ‘ If I have
told him that Ι will give a dowry his suspicions will be roused. I am
afraid to dig the ground, lest he should overhear the sound, and so,
being put upon the right track, should discover the treasure itself.' Neu
co-ordinates the second clause with the first, when it ought strictly to be
subordinated. If Lesbonicus discovered the treasure in his father's
absence, he could legally demand it. See v. 1 146.

dotem dare si dixerim. See on vv. 5 and 736.

756. quo pacto ergo igitur clam dos depromi potest ¹? ‘ how then
can a dowry be secretly taken from the treasure?’ 1t appears that to
