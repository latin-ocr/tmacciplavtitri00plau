80 TRIN VMM VS. [ACT 1.

‘from the country) See Langen, Beitrage p. 308. Unus is used in
the plur. in the sense of solus, as Bacch. 832 tres unos passus, Pseud. 54
unae quinque remorantur minae.

167. inconsultu meo, ἅπαξ εἰρημένον, but like iniussu meo διο.

168. aedis uenaus hasco inscribit litteris, ‘ by means of a bill he
advertises this house for sale.' So Ter. Haut. 144 inscripsi ilico aedis
mercede. For the acc. after inscribere, not strictly a transitive verb, cs.
Cic. Verr. 11. 2. 167 inscribere statuas, and see Roby, L. G. 1 120.

169. adesuriuit...1upus. Magis has been inserted by some one
who did not see that acrius qualified both verbs. Cf. v. 200. Ade-
surire on the analogy of addubitare: ‘to begin to be hungry.' So Stich.
180 essurio acrius. 2The original passage in Philemon was an allusion to
the Greek proverb λύκος ἔχανεν.

170. obseruauit dum dormitaret canes, ⁶ he watched until the dog
(as he thought) was asleep ’—d0rmitaret, not as the Mss. dormitarent,
because one watch-dog only, viz. Callicles, is in question. Plautus uses
canes, the old form of the nom. sing„ along with canis the later form,
by which canes had been replaced in the time of Varro, L. L. VII. 32.

171. gregem uniuersum uoluit totum morters, ‘he wished to
carry off the whole flock entirely.’ The use of totum adj. for adv.
(antimeria) is idiomatic—as in totus doleo, sum totus uester &c.-—nor is the
word otiose aster uniuersum, for uniuersum qualifies gregem while totum
strengthens the verb. So Most. 146 non uideor milti sarcire posse aedes
meas, quin totae perpetuae ruant, ‘to prevent it falling into ruin from end
to end.’

172. haec...cane8, δεικτικῶς, ‘the dog in my person‚’ ‘1 the dog.’
So v. 1115 laic h0m0=ego, Capt. 153 kuic illud dolet, ibid. 335 huius est
cluens, Epid. 74 haec puppis, Pseud. 72 3 hoc caput.

174. quid...facero‘1 The question is put independently, not de-
pendent on fac sciam. Cf. Pseud. 695 id tu modo, me quid uis facere,
fac sciam, where the form is still that of a direct question. Fac, which
is not older than sace, is formed like dic, duc, on the analogy of the
short injunctive forms es, fir, uel: *es-s, *yser-s, *uel-s. Cf. δός, σχές
&c. Dic, sac, διε. are used where the words go closely together as dic
mihi, fac sciam, but where there is anything of a pause dice, face are
used, as Mil. 256 lzaec ei dice, monstra, praecipe. A good instance is
Rud. 124, Daem. tu si quid opus est dice. Ples. dic quod te rog03 where
we have first dice because of the break which follows, then dic closely
combining with the next words. See Lindsay‚ L. L. p. 518. On the
paratactic construction fac sciam, cf. on v. 60.
