142 TRJNVMMVS. [ACT 111.

⁷04. id me commissurum...1nduxeris‚ i.e. ne animum induxeris
me commissurum ut patiar z‘dfleri. Ne animum induxeris=ne credi—
deris, so animum aduerto=animaduerto‚ and κατὰ σύνεσιν is constructed
accordingly. For the emphatic position of id, see on v. 20.

⁷05. non enim possum quin exclamem...⁷rd2tw‚ ‘ I really can't help
shouting out, “bravo‚ bravo, Lysiteles, encore'’.' Stasimus has been
listening all this time. He now shews himself. He is naturally most
anxious that Lesbonicus should not part with the land, for, if the land
goes, exile is assured for him. Stepping forward, he compares the dis-
cussion between the two friends to a dramatic contest (ἀγών) and,
constituting himself judge, awards the prize to Lysiteles and punish·
ment to Lesbonicus. ¹

The passage raises the question whether there were poetical contests
and prizes at Rome. Passages like the Prologues to the Amph. and
Poen. (Amph. 64 ff„ Poen. 36 ff.) are slender evidence to go upon. On
the whole, Mommsen is quite justified in arguing that, from the silence
of Prologues and Didascaliae, we must inser that there were no such
contests. The allusion then belongs to the Greek original, and probably
had no counterpart at Rome. This view is strengthened by v. 708,
q. v.

non enim, ‘really not‚’ ‘indeed not‚' enim is an asseverative particle
as in at enim (v. 919), quia enim, nil enim, numquam enim, certe enim,
immo enim, uerum enim, and enim uero (vv, 958, 987, 989). See on
v. 61.

non possum quin. The impersonal non potest and potin ut=n0nne
potis est ut, v. 628, are used without fleri, hence non possum (nequeo)
without facere. Euge (εὖγε) and πάλιν and Martial's soplqu (σοφῶς), like
most exclamations used at entertainments, are borrowed from Greek, just
as we borrow bravo, da capo, encore from Italian and French, and all
our musical terms from Italian. On Greek words in Plautus, see v. 187.

706. hic uictust, ‘Lesbonicus is beaten ’—but in the next line hic
is Lysiteles. In this line Lysiteles is directly addressed in the second
person, and the change is rather abrupt, but, as with hic...hic Stasimus
points to or touches the person meant, it would be clear’enough on the
stage.

707. agit, the composer and the actor are identified. In the early
history of the Greek Drama the poet always played the leading part.
ex argumento=ut argumento (ὑποθέσει) conuenit, ‘more in character!

708. etlam ob stultitiam tuam te iuris multabo mina. Stasimus
is addressing Lesbonicus. He has been so stupid to get such a beating
