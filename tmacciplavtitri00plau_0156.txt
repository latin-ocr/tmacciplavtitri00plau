tuam est. M. ut quidem emoriar. ‘ Yes! it is to my interest to die
outright.’ Illud, ‘that sum,' after mille drachumarum as v. 405. For
sactum (without est) and factum id quoquest see on v. 127, for quidem

V. 1.
9473θ. nam nunc eum uidi miserum. Here nunc marks a contrast

between the present and the earlier state of things. ‘ Then Ι thought
he was rich: now 1 have seen that he is in sorry state, and I arn
sorry for him.’ Nunc is not infrequently joined with the perf. in
Plautus, if an action is indicated still recent in point of time, in contrast
with an earlier time, e.g. v. 1089 nunc liic disperii miser. See Langen,
Beitr'age pp. 39, 40. ,

431. miseret te aliorum, tui nec miseret nee pudet. A chiasmus
as VV. 701, 1129.

433. ne is ne* confirmatiua, strengthening the asseveration edepol.

434. peculio, ⁴ savings.' Peculium is the regular word for a slave's
savings, scraped together with a view to purchasing his freedom (v. 564,
Stich. 751). Stasimus as a slave uses the slave’s phraseology, and says
that he would like to ‘own Philto with his savings,’ sor the slave had
no legal right to property, and held even savings only by his master's
indulgence. In other words, then, Stasimus means, ‘ Philto has a nice
fortune : I wish it could become mine.'

435. erum atque seruom. The salutation of slave as well as
master is Greek, not Roman.

436. duint, pres. subj. (properly optative, see on v. 6) from the old -
Latin pres. duo, and used, as archaic forms generally are, at the end of
the line. The forms used by Plautus are duim, duis, duit, duint-
obviously convenient forms to end an iambic line—and from compounds
interduim v. 994, perduim, perdici& perdicit, creduis, cmduit, and, most
common of all, perduint.

438. edepol mutuom meeum facit, ‘ saith, Ι reciprocate his feeling.’
So Mil. 12 53 mutuom fit, sc. a me, Pers. 766, L. omnia quae tu uis, ea
cupio. T. mutua fiunt a me.

439. nequam illud uerbumst ‘ bene uolt,’ mei qm bene facit,
‘That is a worthless expression, unless a man crowns “ kind wishes ’²
with kind deeds.' Nisi qui :nisi quis=el μή τις, as vv. 257 ubi qui eget
and 1005 nisi qui illud tractet. The indeclinable adj. nequam again,
v. 1036.

440. nequiquam uolo. Wislzes, says Stasimus, are useless. Ι wish
to be free, but (as I cannot purchase my freedom) I wish in vain.
Nequiquam (i.e. rie-quiquam, the modal abl. used adv.), ‘not in any
