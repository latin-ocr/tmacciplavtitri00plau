170 TRJNVMMVS. [Aer lv.

9⁷4. nimis argute obrepsisti in eapse occasiuncula, ‘you stole in
very cleverly just when I gave you a bit of an opening.’ Like a boxer
who seizes his opportunity, when for a second his adversary is off his
guard. The Sycophant gave Charmides only the least possible opening,
Charmides had seized it cleverly, and the Sycophant has a professional
admiration for his adroitness. The hiatus may stand, and it is a difficult
question whether me should be inserted or not. Supr. v. 61, the verb
has a direct object, but Pseud. 686 ut mors obrepat interim, it is
absolute.

975. postquam...post‚ as v. 417.

977. prom tu te, itidem ut charmidatus es, rursum recharmlda,
‘therefore do you, just as you Charmidised yoursels, un-Charmidise your·
self.’ You made yourself Charmides, now unmake yourself. 72·
recharmidare, where re has the same force as in sero, reseras claudo,
recludo ; probo, reprobo &c- Some editors maintaining that on analogy‚
as re is compounded with a noun, recharmz'dare ought to mean ‘re-
Charmidise,’ write decharmz‘da. But re can have the force required,
viz. ‘un-,³ and that is quite enough for a comic writer.

979. mea causa: per me: ἐμοῦ ’γε ἕνεκα, ‘for all I care.’ So Epid.
679 quaeras mea causa uel medio in mari, Rud. 139 mea quidem hercle
causa saluos sis licet, Pseud. 123 de istac re in oculum utrumuis conquies-
cito, ‘so far as that goes,' τούτου ’γε ἕνεκα.

980. qui tum—non eras. The Sycophant pauses an instant before
the παρὰ προσδοκίαν ending non eras.

981. age siquid agn, ‘act‚ if you're going to act‚' i.e. ‘aetat once‚’
‘if you mean business, now’s your time.' So Epid. 196, Mil. 215, Pers.
¹46 hoc, sifacluru’s,face‚ Poen. 1237 ite si itis, Stich. 710 bibe si bibis.

dorm-itas, ‘you're dreaming,' i.e. ‘talking nonsense.’ Dormitare in
Plautus is generally either ‘to act as if one were asleep,’ i.e. to sit idle
and dreaming, as Asin. 2 5 3, Epid. 162, or ‘to talk as if one were asleep,'
not to know what one is saying.

982. scriptum quidem, ‘at any rate he gave me an order for it.’
He had said, v. 965, that it was numeratum, now he admits that it was
only scriptum. See on vv, 965 and 971. So Asin. 440 scribit nummos.

983. For properas an non properas others read properas an non
propere, when properas propere is figura etymologica, and the two
practically identical adverbs propere and actutum are parallelled by
such lines as Cas. 11. 4. 13 actutum uxorem huc euoca ante aedis cito.

984. dormitator, as v. 862.

985. ulum quem ementitus es, ‘the man whom you pretended to
