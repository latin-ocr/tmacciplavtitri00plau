B=Callicles‚ P=Lysiteles, A=Philto, E=Lesbonicus‚ H=Stasimus‚
O=Charmides and X=Sycophanta. In all probability the last word
or words were delivered, not by a'special Cantor, but by one of the
actors then on the stage in the name cf the rest. Probably one actor
spoke in the name os the rest, even when, as in Asin„ Capt.‚ Epid„ the
closing lines are assigned to the whole troupe (grex or caterua).

It is characteristic of Plautus that the play is quickly hurried to its
conclusion. The expositio and the z'nuolutz'o are full and caresul, the
euolutio is very rapid. ·1t begins only v. 1093, and less than one
hundred lines serve to end the play.
