cletis, forms attested by Charisius, p. 13²· But as Callicli is the regular
Plautine gen. (v. 744) it is simplest with Hermann to insert huius after
Callicli. Haec and liuius are then both used δεικτικῶς, llaec pointing to
the house where the girl is, liuius to Callicles, who stands by Charmides’
side.

1184. iubebis, sc. ducere.

1185. una goes with miseria, ‘one affliction is quite enough for one
man.' This does not sound complimentary to Mrs Charmides, who is
not mentioned in the play, perhaps because her husband has had no
chance to jest about her, as Callicles and Megaronides had done about
their wives v. 51 ff.

adfatim is ad and the acc. of an old noun fatis, ‘weariness‚' like
satis, ‘abundance,' forming an adv. like acl-modum. See Poen. 5 34 ubi
bibas, edas de alieno quantum uelis usque ad fatim3 in Men. 457 ad·
fatimst hominum, ‘there are plenty of men,' the noun-force offatim is
also clearly seen.

1186. par-umet, ‘it is too little.’ We say ‘it would be too little,'
but the Latin idiom is est, as longum est, inscitia est, luxuria est &c.

1187. ⁴[lamperabm sc. milzz‘.

dicis, sl facies modo. The old contrast between promise and per-
formance, λόὙῳ...ἕρ’γῳ; si modo or modo si, ‘if only,' almost=utz'nam,
as Capt. 996 quod male feci crucior .· modo si infletum fieri possiet.

1188. optumumst, see v. 52. Licet ‘assentientis' is apparently a
gloss on optumumst incorporated into the text. optumumst, ‘capital‚'
gives Charmides’ assent to the marriage of Lysiteles.

1189. tu, turning to Lesbonicus, ⁴(Lysiteles is to be married to·
morrowz) do you be ready to take home your bride the next day.'
‘Peren-die, ‘the day aft‘er to-morrow,’ is connected with the Oscan
perum, ‘without' (originally ‘beyond‚’ cf. Gk. πέρᾶ), of the phrase
perum dolam mallom=sine dolo malo, and means literally ‘on the be-
yond day.' ’ Lindsay, L. L. p. 560.

Ω. The play like all the Plautine plays ends with a request for
applause. That request is made in the single word plaudite here, Mil.
and Poen.; in Rud. plausum date3 in Cure. spectatores, plaudite3 in
Amph.‚ Pers., Men„ Most., Stich„ Truc. a whole line3 in Asin„ Bacch„
Capt., Epid., Pseud. διε. several lines. Terence has Plaudite or uos ualete
et plaudite. The belief that there was a special Cantor who made this
request is based upon Horace’s lines A. P. 154 si plausoris eges aulaea
manentis et usque Ι sessuri donec cantor ‘ uos plaudite' dicat, with Bentley's
theory that Ω which is found in the MSS· of Terence and the Trinummus
