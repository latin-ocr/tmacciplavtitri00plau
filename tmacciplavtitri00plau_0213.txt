coin but a ‘counter’ or ‘token‚’ like our stage-money. Most. 89² tace
sis, faber, qui cudere soles plumbeos nummos.

si=etiam si, ‘even if’; and so often in Plautus, as Asin. 164, 405, 414.

963. heus, Pax, te tribus uerbis uolo. The rest of the speech has
been ‘thinking aloud ’ on Charmides’ part. Now he turns to the Syco-
phant with ‘I want just a word with you.’ For the elliptic construction
te uolo, see on v. 516, on tria as an indefinitely small, and trecenta as
an indefinitely large number, see on v. 791.

965. atque etiam Philippum, ‘yes and a thousand (of) Philippes
d ’0r.' Philippum and numeratum belong to nummum, which is short
gen. plur. after mille, as v. 959.

numeratum, ‘paid down by him in person at the Bank.’ Numerare,
‘to count out,’ ‘to pay down in cash‚’ Asin. 193, Epid. 305, Ou. her.
XII. 199 dos ubi sit quaeris? Campo numerauimus illo &c- Numerare,
‘to pay in cash ' )( perscribere, ‘to pay by draft.’ The Sycophant boasts
that he has cash, and not a draft. This is untrue, and he soon has to
eat his words, v. 98²·

966. nempe, as V. 196.

967. mirum quin. . acciperem, ‘strange that I did not receive it &c.’
mirum quin with subj. always ironical. See on v. 495.

968. cedodum, ‘just hand that money to me.' Cedd (plur. cette for
*ce-dite), ‘here give’= ‘give me ' or ‘tell me‚’ is composed of the pro-
nominal element *Zeu prefixed as a prep. to the athematic imperative *do*
(cf. δί-δω). The final vowel is properly long, but is invariably shortened
by the ‘breuis breuians' law after the short σέ. On the use of -dum, see
v. 98.

971. auro hulc quidem, ‘for this money at least‚’ ‘at any rate so
far as this money is concerned.' Quidem limits and corrects‚ and is
especially so used after demonstratives, e.g. vv. 58 a'umqus'dem, ‘pro-
vided at least‚' 363 sapiens quidem, 419, Capt. 335 pol is quidem, ibid.
336 hoc quidem, ibid. 564, 573, 657, 668, 750, 974. See Brix on Capt.
357. Α3 here, quidem limits the general statement, ‘you never shall be
Charmides‚' to the restricted meaning, ‘for this money‚’ so ν. 982
scriptum quidem corrects and limits his statement that Charmides had
given him the money. ‘At any rate (if he had not given the cash) he
had given an order for it.’ In fact quidemz'ye in all its senses.

9⁷2. ab1,-see on v. 830, ‘come, come! please, swindler, you expect
to swindle a swindler, ’ Nugarz' nugatori, as v. 958. Pastum, v. 237.
The Sycophant makes no bones about admitting what heis, but objects

to another man trenching on his privileges·
