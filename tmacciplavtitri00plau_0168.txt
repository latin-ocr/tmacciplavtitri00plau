atmosphere where even the hardiest race of slaves, the Syrians, pined
away 3 such unfeeling mockeries reflected the scorn of the victors, and
re-echoed the cry of distress from the down-trodden nations.’

546. multo Syrorum tam antidit. patientia, i.e. iam multo antidit
patientia Syrorum genus. A ntidit is the archaic form of anteit. A ntid
is like postid v. 529, and from it are formed antidlzac, which Plautus-uses
when he wants a trisyllable, as antehac is a dissyllable, and antidea
(Liv. xxu. 10. 6). Antidit is used eight times by Plautus, anteit only
once, Amph. 649, but Terence always has anteit.

. 54⁷. sed istest ager profecto, ut te audiui loqui, ‘but assuredly
that is the land, according to your shewing &c.' Sed breaking off, and
changing the subject, as v. 16. Vt te audiui loqui=‘ as 1 understand
your words‚' i.e. if I understand you rightly—ut in this way generally
with audio and uideo, Capt. 569, Most. 993, Pseud. 99.

548. publice: δημοσίᾳ, ‘ by the state,' ‘ at the public expense.’

549. fortunatorum insulam i.e. μακάρων νῆσοι where, aster death,
ὄλβιοι ἥρωες lived a lise of the gods. See Hesiod, Works 170 ff„ Pind.
Ol. 11. 128 διε.

551. contra. istoc &c., ‘so on the other hand it seems right that evil-
doers should be packed off thither, if indeed it is as you describe it.’
Istoc adv. = in istmzc agrum, whence also qui (ager) in the next line. Istoc
for later istuc, as hoc sor lzuc, illo, isto διο. ‘It is unnatural to regard
-uc as anything but a later phonetic development of the earlier -0c.’
Lindsay, L. L. p. 569.

552. qui quidem istius sit modi is a sly hint on Philto’s part that
he is not swallowing all Stasimus says. qui quidem herezsi, as Men.
204, where to the remark ‘that is the proper spirit of lovers,’ Peniculus
retorts qui quidem ad mendicitatem se properent detrudere, ‘yes, if they
are in haste &c.’ But qui quidem is causal Bacch. 1132, merito hoc nobis
fit, qui quz‘dem lzuc uenen‘mus.

553. nospitiumst calamitatis, ‘the abode of disaster.’ Cf. damni
conciliabulum v. 314, and the use of hospitium v. 673.

554. quamuis malam rem quaeras, ‘look sor any evil you like, you
would find it there.’ Quaeras=si quaeras. Quamuis is not used in the
ordinary Plautine manner as an adv. See on v. 380. Here quamuis
:quam lubet, ‘any you please.’ But Brix takes it=rem quamuis mala
sit quaeras, ‘look for a thing no matter how bad it is.’ It is, 1 think,
against this rendering that mala res=malum and practically one word

(see v, 1045), and that its meaning: ‘a thrashing' forms the point of the
next line.
