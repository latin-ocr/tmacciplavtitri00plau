1 16 TRIN VMM VS. [Ac-1* 11.

⁶ sharing a biclinium with you’: the Romans regularly used a tri-
clinium.

470. adposita cena sit, ‘suppose a banquet is served up.’ Con-
structio ἀσύνδετος. The force of si is continued as in the sentence vv.
217—220. But the line is suspected and should perhaps be bracketed,
as, apart from the fact that it complicates the construction, in aedem
v. 468 sufficiently explains the nature of the banquet.

471. si 1111, &c- A supposition within a supposition. The first si
introduces the general scene—the temple, the public banquet, and the
proximity of the rich man. The second si introduces the particular
moment at which the great man's dependents have heaped dainties
before him.

472. siquid tibi placeat δια, ‘supposing anything that had been
put before him took your fancy, would you eat it or sit at table with
the rich man supperless?’ Edis and edim v. 474 are optative forms.
See on v. 6.

474. edim, nisi sl ine notet, ‘I would eat, unless indeed he forbade
me.' On uolet see v. 457. Nisi si= εἰ μὴ εἰ, and introduces an exception
which is less likely than one introduced by nisi, an exception so unlikely
that it is worth mentioning‚ and that is all. Cf. Amph. 825, Capt. 530,
Epid. 22.

475. malis, ‘jaws.’ Mala is formed with the suffix ·sl‘2‚ and is for
mag-sla. Cf. ᾶία (*axla)‚ malus (mue—sle), uilum (uec-slum), &c- See
Miiller, Handbuch 11². p. 3¹0·

476. potissumum, ‘what he liked I would grab in preference to
anything else.’

477. de uita mea, commonly taken as ‘my victuals,' but ⁴better
understood as ‘of what is li e for me‚’ i.e. the dainties and the enjoyment
which make lise worth living for Stasimus.

478. uerecundari...cern1tur, ‘no one ought to be bashful—to have
any false shame-at table: for there the distinction is between things
divine and things human.' Cernitur=decernitur‚ κρίνεται, i.e. the only
distinction made is between the parts to be offered to the gods, and the
parts to be eaten by men 3 and once a portion is assigned as humanum
(and not diuinum), one man has as much right to it as another.

480. rem fabularezdxnofi λέγεις. So Epid. 288 rem loquere, and
stronger Pers. 93 rem loquitur meram.

non tibi dicam dolo. Cf. v. 90.

481. de uia, de semita, ‘from the road, from the footpath.’ So
Cure. 287 quin capite sistat in uia de semita: ‘be thrust off the footpath
