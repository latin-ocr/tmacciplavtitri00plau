223. simxtu is an old formzsimul, used frequently by Plautus,
found as an archaism in some inscriptions of the Empire, and quoted
by Nonius with examples from Plautus and Lucilius. Plautus elides the
last syllable, Stich. 249 mecum simitu ut ires ad sese domum.

224. indipiscon from indu (ende) and apiscor, is more frequent in
Comedy than apiscor or adipiscor. Cf. induperator, old Latin for
imperator, indugredi for ingredi, indaudire and indutiae, and Greek
ἔνδον, ἔνδο-θι, guae-osv. See Lindsay, L. L. pp. 582, 583. .

225. egomet...defet1go‚ ‘I vex and distress and wear myself out-⁹
Coquo often in poetryz‘vex‚' as Ennius Ann. 340 cura quae nunc te
coquit3 macero regularly in Plautus of the effects of grief and the like,
as Capt. 133 tuo maerore maceror. Defetzgro (not defatzgo) is the best

’ 'spelling in early Latin, though defatigo is usual later.

226. magister exercitur, ‘master trainer ’—two nouns where adj.
and noun would be normal. But cf. Pers. 780 dies corruptor, seruos
homo, ἀνὴρ στρατιώτης, &c. In v. 1016 exercitor only. The reflections
of his mind keep Lysiteles as busily employed as the παιδοτρίβης does a
boy in the Palaestra, i.e. his thoughts are task-masters. Exercitffr, and
so v. 1016.

227. sed, ‘but still,’ despite all my exertions in thinking.

228. artem, ‘which plan of life of these (two) I am to choose by
preference.’ Artem, see on v. 72: harum is explained by amor and res
in v. 230.

229. aetati agundae firmiorem, ‘ which 1 am to consider the more
secure (ἀσφαλέστεραν) sor the conduct of life! The dat. is the ‘dat. of
work contemplated,' see Roby, L. G. 1156 and ¹157·

230. amorln med an rei opsequi potius par sit, ‘whether it is
right for me to give my adhesion by preference to love or to money.'
Rei = quaestui, and rei obsequi: rei studere. Meti, the old Latin acc„
which by the time of Terence has become mi, owing to the Latin
