1006. sed quis luc est, &c- Charmides catches sight of Stasimus
hurrying up, and retires into the angiportum to watch him. Sed quis
hic est qui, a regular formula to announce the entrance of a fresh
character, vv· 840 and 1151, and so estne hic...qui, v. 43²·

1007. concessero. Cf. v. 625. Charmides withdraws‚ listens to

Stasimus, and comments on what he says. He does not shew himself
till v. 1059.

SCENE 4 (1008—1092). Stasimus rushes on in a great hurry. He
has been to have a drink‚ and is hurrying to make up sor lost time. He
finds he has left a ring behind him in the tavern‚ and does not know
whether to go back sor it or to hasten on. Charmides listens to him
and comments on what he says up to v. 1059, when, having recognised
him as his own slave, he accosts him.

A slave hurrying across the stage, shouting and clearing people out
of the way, was a favourite subject in Comedy. The length of the
Roman stage enabled a man running to be kept in sight for some time.

1008. propere celerem, the use of a cognate adv. to intensify the
meaning of the adj„ an extension of the figura etymologica. Cf. v. 931

dominum, he means of course Lesbonicus, not Charmides, whom he
has no expectation of seeing.

1009. metus exoriatur scapulis, ‘lest apprehension arise for your
shoulder-blades,' i.e. lest you come into danger of a flogging. The sear
is not differentiated from the thing feared, and so Capt. 519 neque adeo
spes, quae hunc mi aspellat metum, where subjective and objective are
not distinguished ε scapulis as Asin. 547 scapularum confidentia.

1011. ne bubuli in te cottabi crebri crepent, ‘lest cowhide cracks
constantly crackle on your back.' The word cottabi is clearly taken
from the original, where the allusion was to the Greek game κότταβος.
In the game wine was skilfully jerked out of a glass so as to make
a sharp, ringing sound on a suspended metal-vessel. Stasimus means
that the ringing sound will be produced on his back, and made not with
wine but with oxhide whips. Slaves in Comedy delight in dwelling
