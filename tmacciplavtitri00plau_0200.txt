The period is a long one. It begins with an ‘is’ clause, absque soret
te=si sine te foret, then follows the apodosis distraxissent &c- The
reason for the statement is given in ita &c. (which might be replaced by
a nam clause), and ita is followed first by descriptive imperf„ then by
hist. infin. Finally, to couple the whole period more closely together,
the original protasis is repeated in a different and fuller form—ni tua
pax propitia soret praesto is absque foret te ‘writ large.’ Cf. the period

The Sycophant does not see Charmides, who watches him, till v. 871.

SCENE 2 (843—997). Enter the Sycophant‚ disguised as a
foreigner. Charmides watches the Sycophant‚ then v. 871 he shews
