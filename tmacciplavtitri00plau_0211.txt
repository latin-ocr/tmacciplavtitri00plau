quite in place here. If repetition and redundancy are always to be
cut out, Plautus will not be Plautus. See Langen, Plaut. Stud. p. 80.

937. quae. Brix is probably right in saying that ‘quae is not for
quod, but means “places which ''.' Egomet goes with unde redeam, as
with ubi sim, v. 9²9·

The MSS. give here the three lines 889-891, which were restored to
their place by Meier.

938. nisi quia, ‘only that Ι have a fancy sor finding out where he
will end at last.' Ι am foolish sor questioning him, (and I should not
question him) except because δια, i.e. Ι ought not to question him any
more, still Ι will see where he gets to in the end. See Langen, Beitrage,
p. 58, and on v. 233.

939. porro, ‘farther,' see on v. 162.

si animum adum-tes, eloquar. The fut. here, pres. subj. v. 897.
But either construction is admissible.

940. qui de caelo exoritur sub solio leuia, a literal way of taking
such an epithet as the Homeric διιπετής applied to a river, as Od.
ιν. 477.

942. immo horiola aduecti sumus, ‘no! we sailed there in a bit of
a smack) Horiola is a small fishing·boat, a rare diminutive of heria,
Rud. 910.

943. usque aqua. aduersa per amnem, ⁴ by river all the way against
the stream‚’ i-e. ‘up stream.'

944. alii dl isse ad umam aiebant seruis depromptum cibum,
‘the other gods told us he had gone to his country seat to serve out
rations to the slaves.' Jupiter is represented as a landed proprietor who
goes to his property on the first of the month, to distribute to his slaves
their monthly allowance (demensum, demensus cibus). Cf. Stich. 60 (a
master addressing his slaves) uos meministzzv quot kalendis petere demen-
sum cibum. A liz· :ceteri in popular language.

945. Charmides is getting tired of the Sycophant’s absurd lies,
and euts him short.

946. The letters printed in italics are Leo’s conjectures. They
keep the MSS. distribution of the text between the speakers, fit in all
that is left in the MSS„ and are to my mind far superior to anything
proposed.

sed, ‘but' remonstrates the Sycophant. Charmides will not listen
to him, ‘ Ι assure you I'm off, if you annoy me.' He is tired of the
pretended journey and will no more of it.

nam pudicum neminem, Pax, referre oportet, qui aps terra ad.
