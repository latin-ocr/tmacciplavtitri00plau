1 00 T RIN VM M VS. [ACT 11.

qui est amicus ita ut nomen possidet, nisi deos ei nil praestare, Cas. 655
tua ancilla, quam tu tuo uilico uis dare uxorem, ea intus.

nempe de tuo ⁶2 ‘ at your own expense I presumeP' For nempe in a
question, see on v. 196. The question is ironical‚ for Lysiteles cannot
yet call anything his own. With de tuo cf. Bacch. 98 ad eam operam
facere sumptum de tuo, Truc. 953 noster esto—sed de uostro uiuito.

331. publicisne adfinis tuit an maritumis negotiis ⁷ ‘was he
engaged in tax-farming or sea-trade?' The passage raises difficulties.

Adfinis in the sense ‘connected with' is followed by the dat„ Cic. pro
Sulla 70 huic adfines sceleri, as it is by the gen. Cic. pro Sulla 17

liuius adfines suspicionis, and Ter. Haut. 215 illarum adfines rerum:

but in Plautus, with the exception of this passage, it always means
‘a connexion by marriage: as vv. 422, 622, 626, 1163. Nor is the
meaning of publica negotia plain. It can hardly mean ordinary ‘public
business’ with the notion that a man is so engrossed in the affairs of the
state that he has no time to attend to his own. But it may perhaps
mean the business of the publicani, who farmed the revenue and often no
doubt lost money. See Langen, Beitriige, p. 272. Plautus himself is
said to have lost his money in marituma negotia.

332. mercaturam, an uenalis habuit, ubi rem perdidit ‘1 ‘was it
by commerce, or was he a slave-dealer‚ when he lost his money?’
Mercaturan, i.e. mercaturane rem perdidit, but the structure of the
sentence is disjointed because the alternative (an uenalis habuit) has a
verb of its own, and so what ought to be the principal verb is thrust
into the temporal clause ubi rem perdidit. Venales (seruos) habere: ‘to
be a slave-dealer‚' which is characterised Capt. 98 as quaestus inhonestus.

333. per comitatem ‘(he lost his money) through his liberality.’
So v. 356 and Rud. 38 rem bene paratam comitate perdidit.

334. animi eausa, ⁴ for pleasure's sake‚' ‘to gratify his inclinations.'
So Epid. 45 3 Rud. 9323 Aesch. Choeph. 750 τρόπῳ φρενός.

335. edepol hominem praemandatum terme familiai-lter, ‘upon
my word you recommend the fellow quite like an intimate friend? On
the acc. of exclamation aster edepol see on v. 128. praemandatum is
the reading of A. Praemandatum ‘recommended besorehand' because
Lysiteles' object in introducing him has not yet been explained. On the
use of the word see Langen, Beitrage p. 307. The Palatine text gives
praedicatum, ‘described,' but that in this sense' is ‘unplautine.’ A
perhaps has firme, but BC ferme.

336. quiquidem as v. 953. atque, ‘and yet.’

337. nil moror as v. 297· cum eius modi uirtutibus, ‘with
