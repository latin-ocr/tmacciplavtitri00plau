(of) Plzilz‘ppes d'or of dowry.' Accordingly Langen (Beitr'age p. 85 ff.)
would bring this passage into line with the common usage by reading
nummum aureum Philippum ad tria milia, ‘ amounting to three
thousand Philippes d’or.' Other passages where the coin is mentioned
are Asin. 153, Bacch. 230 and 1183, Rud. 1314.

153. id, ‘that fact‚’ ‘that secret‚’ rather than ⁴ that sum of money.’
Id is the object of crederem, see v. 20.

solus solum=m5vos μόνον. Cf. Asin. 500 solus milii talentum argenti
soli adnumerauu, Capt. 602 solus te solum uolo, Mil. 1019 cedo te milli
solae solum, Pseud. 1142 praesens praesentem, Stich. 373 ipsus ipsum.

155. unde=a qua, as Epid. 80 and 115, and often.

permanascere‚ ἅπαξ εἰρημένον, an inceptive form of permane <see
Capt. 221 neu permanet palam lzaec nostra fallacia), intended to express
the slow and secret spreading of the news.

156. revenit, pres„ although the verb in the main sentence is fut.
So ν. 713, Capt. 409 and 587.

reddam suom sibi, ‘ I will restore to him his own,' i.e. the treasure.
We should expect ei not sibi. But suom draws the dat. into its neigh-
bourhood and makes it reflexive. So often in the Comedians suom sibi
and the like, e.g. Pers. 81 sua sibi pecunia hodie illam faciat leno libertam
suam, Poen. 1083 suam sibi rem saluam sistam. See Roby, L. G. 1143
and 2265.

157. siquid eo fuerit, ‘ if anything should happen to him‚’ a
euphemism like siquid eo acciderit, εἴ τι πάθοι, to avoid saying ‘if he
dies.’ After facere and fieri the abl. (instr.) is the regular construction,
e. g. v. 594 quid ea re fuat, Truc. 799 quid eo fecisti puero? Truc. 417
quid me futurumst? But occasionally where a person is in question
the dat. is used, as Men. 663 quid milti futurumst ,2 =rl μοι ’γένωμαις
and so v. 822.

158. habeo dotem unde dem, ‘ I have' the means for providing a
dowry &c.’ But the hiatus is very harsh. Perhaps we should read ut
inde dem or ei liabeo dotem unde dem.

159. ut...con.locem. The order is ut conlocem eam (filiam) in con-
dicionem dignam se. Conlocare, ‘to settle ' and condicio, ‘a match‚’
‘ partie ' as v. 455, are specially used of marriage. Se is abl. aster
dignam: for the order in se dignam see Madvig, Advers. crit. 11. p. 514.
The separation of the preposition from its case by another word is usual
in oaths and adjurations ( per te deos oro &c.)‚ but otherwise-is almost
confined to poetry.

160. pro (11 inmortales, a purely colloquial exclamation, ‘good
