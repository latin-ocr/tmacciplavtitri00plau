is almost always at the end. The word is sometimes separated into post
id, but as the old Latin form of post is poste (e.g. Asin. 915), it is better
taken as '‘posti' with the particle *d(e). See Lindsay, L. L. p. 588. The
word is also used in the phrase postid locorum (e.g. Truc. 661), with
which cf. interea loci &c. The form postidea, as Aul. 118, also makes
it very unlikely that postid' is post id.

530. tribus tantis im minus, ‘when elsewhere there 1s a very heavy
harvest, the yield there is three times less than one sowed.’Tr1bus
tantis, abl. of measure after minus, constructed like Bacch. 1034 sescenta
tanta reddam, si uiuo, tibi. Redire, reditus, of the profit, revenue,
‘income’ yielded by an estate. Illi, ‘there'=in eo agro, adv„ and so
again v. 555. Illic=illi 4- ce.

532. sl...possint intentiori, ‘to see whether they can be killed off!
For si cf. v. 763. Interften’ is an archaic passive of interficio, here only
in Plautus, used also Lucr. 111. 872 interfiat.

534. qum pessume ei res uorterit, ‘but that for him things have
turned out very badly? ‘Nor has anyone ever owned that sarm without
things turning out very badly for him.'

quorum is an emendation of quoium B, cuium A, ciuium C. ‘Os those
whose property it had been' &c. If quoium be retained, it may possibly
be gen. plur. of the relative, or may on the analogy of nostrum &c- be
gen. plur. of the possessive of the relative quoius -a -um. However,
quoius in the previous line and two lines later is gen. sing. of the relative
and seems to demand the gen. plur. quorum here. But see Lindsay,
L. L., p. 447.

535. exulatum, ‘have gone off to live in exile‚' supine after the verb
of motion abierunt, as Liv. 11. 36. 5 in Volscos exulatum abiit. A gives
exalatum, and Nonius, p. 123, quotes alii exsoluti abierunt. The spell-
ing with o as the older is perhaps more correct here. So consol (co'sol)
is the prevailing spelling in Inscriptions till the Third Punic War.

emortui, sc. sunt. The omission of sunt is not nearly so common
as the omission of est. Where sunt is omitted it will be found to be
generally after a perf. pass. part. as v. 426, or in a relative or tempor-al
clause, as νν. 393 and 1049. The word is omitted, as here, in a lively
narrative Asin. 555, Rud. 207.

537. ut ad incitas redanimata, ‘see how the present owner is reduced
to extremities‚’ or ‘ driven to his last move.' The phrase is borrowed from
a game resembling draughts rather than chess. When the player was
driven into a corner, he was said ad incitas (calces) redigi. Ciere=to
move the pieces, and z‘n·citas=‘not moved‚' i.e. he was checkmated.
