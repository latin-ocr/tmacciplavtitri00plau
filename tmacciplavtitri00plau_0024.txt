pronouns as apud me, apud uos), in 3rd sing. of verbs before ‘a
consonant. Thus ualet pugilice. Hence atque.

Brix points out that this shortening process only takes place
when the accent precedes the shortened syllable. Thus tene,
but contine. And if there is a pause after such words, so that
the last syllable must be more emphasised than it would other-
wise be, the word usually has its proper length3 ueni, iube,
pane, &e

He confines shortening generally to syllables that precede
and follow that on which the accent falls.

In this Brix follows Corssen. Ussing denies that the
accent has any such force in Plautus. He considers that a
long syllable following a short is shortened by assimilation.
Whatever the explanation, at least the fact remains (1) that the
shortened syllable must stand after a short one and is always
next—whether next before or next after—the accent, (2) that the
shortening is most frequent in forms properly iambiC, and in
longer words and combinations of words that commence with
an iambus. The combinations of words where this shortening
takes place commence with a monosyllable, or a dissyllable with
the second vowel elided, followed by a syllable properly long,
e.g. quod in manu, Abi in malam rem, ego obsonabo, &ol

This shortening process depends entirely upon popular pro-
nunciation‚ which it reflects. It is not a poetic licence, not
dependent upon the laws of metre.

The shortening of finals properly long must have been helped
by the influence of the expiratory accent in Early Latin.

B. Lengthening of short syllables. —

Plautus keeps long or makes long a number of terminations
that became regularly short by the time of the Augustan
poets.

Thus es (sum)' 1s regularly long in Comedy.

So often the termination ὃι· in comparatives, as auctior, sub-
stantives‚ amor, verbs, fateor, particles‚ ecastor.

He keeps long, where it suits him, conjugation- endings in
