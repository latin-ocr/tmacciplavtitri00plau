drew its name from the lanx· satura, a dish filled with mixed
fruits‚ hence a kind of poetical potpourri‚ or tutti frutti‚ and
which forms the stepping-stone from the inartistic dramatic
forms to the regular drama of Liuius Andronicus. The Satura
contained various dramatic representations without any unity of
plan—pictures of customs‚ scenes of popular life &c. It is quite
distinct from the burlesque popular comedy, fabulae Atellanae,
an Oscan play (ludicrum Oscum) originating in the Campanian
town of Atella and thence transplanted to Rome. These Atel-
lanae possessed a degree of regular plot and dramatic unity,
accompanied by fixed invariable characters (Maccus, Pappus,
Bucco, Dossennus). The metre in the Songs was Saturnian.
In the Atellanae Roman citizens appeared as actores,· the
Satura was performed by professional players, histriones. At
a later date Atellanae were put upon the stage as after—pieces
to tragedies, and as such were termed exodia.

The Greek influence upon Roman Literature dates from the
F irst Punic War. Liuius Andronicus (born at Tarentum not
later than 284 B.C.—died at an advanced age not before 208 B.C.)
was brought to Rome as a prisoner of war after the capture of
Tarentum 272. He was first the slave, then the freedman of
M. Liuius Salinator, and in 240 B.C., i.e. only 50 years after the
death of Menander, when Rome was enjoying the peace that
followed the First Punic War (Hor. Epist. 11. Ι. 161), brought
out the first play after a Greek original and thereby gave a
further impetus to Roman Literature, which was already fast
developing in this direction. His activity was devoted to
Tragedy rather than Comedy, and his style as a semigraecus
was so rough that Cicero's dictum (Cic. Brut. 71) is Liuianae
fabulae non satis dignae quae iterum legantur.

He was followed by Cnaeus Naeuius (born about 274, died
204) a Campanian who came at an early age to Rome. Naeuius,
who fought in the First Punic War, sung of it in Saturnian verse.
Then, in 235 B.C. according to Gellius (XVII. 21. 44), he brought
out plays at Rome—fabulas apud populum dedit. Like the
poets of the Old Attic Comedy he made his plays the vehicle of
his political feelings and attacked the leading men—the Metelli
