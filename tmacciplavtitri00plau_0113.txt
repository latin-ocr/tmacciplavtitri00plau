sc. 11.] NOTES. 69

69. men? ne‘ interrogatiua, ‘whatt me?’

70. tene obiurigem ‘1 ‘whether it is you‚' &a

71. dicturum male, foll. by dat. mihimet, as male dicere, nec recte
dicere=male dicere &c. take dat. mihimet is the dat. strengthened by
-met‚ as it sometimes is by -pte, mihipte. Other similar forms are
egomet, tutimet, tibimet, temet. Met is found occasionally with posses-
sives in Plautus, but not in Cicero or Caesar. It is thus more a particle
for personal than for possessive pronouns. But -pte is common with
possessives, but almost exclusively with the abl„ as meopte ingenio, suapte
manu. See Lindsay, L. L. p. 4²9·

72. artes antiquae tuae, ‘your good old ways! Antiquae in a
good sense like vv. 295 and 381 z ανίεεεέπιτηδεύματα. So Ter. Andr.
3² ff. nihil istac opus est arte ad hanc rem quam paro, sed eis..2fide et
taciturnitate, infr. v. 228, and malae artes, improbae artes often. aegro-
tant as v. 30. The three lines which follow are spurious. The first is
not found in A. The second repeats the same thing in another way,
and the two lines cannot stand together. The third looks like an
interpolated gloss. Eos is weak, ast is very rare in Plautus, captare
nouos mores is not a Plautine phrase. Further‚ mores is wrongly
used in the passage. The three lines may be safely enclosed in
brackets.

75. morbum tu incuties grauem: take this line as the apodosis
of v. 72=‘you will produce in all your friends' or ‘will inoculate all
your friends with a serious disorder.' Callicles is spoken of as if he
were highly infectious. The nature of the ‘disorder’ is explained by
the next line.

76. ut te uidere audireque aegroti sient, ‘making them sick to
see and hear you’zut uisus et auditus tuus iis morbus sit. The infin.
was merely a ease (usually dat. or loc. sing.) of a verbal noun. Here
uae'dere=*uz'de-st‚ audire=audi—si, i.e. they are loc. from an s—stem.
This origin of the infin. will explain its use, known as the complementary
or epexegetic infin„ to define or complete the meaning of an adj„ as
aegroti here. Cf. Merc. 288 non sum occupatus umquam amico operam
dare, ibid. 805 defessus sum urbem totam peruenarier. It will also
explain the so·called infin. of purpose, as infr. v. 1015 recurre petere.

77. qui, ‘how,' abl. of the interrogative as v. 87: see on v. 14.
Scan istaec, and in the next line amnis.

dicta dicere, ‘to say saws,’ ‘to vent witticisms‚’ is an instance of the
common figura etymologica, like messem metere v. 32, seruire seruitutem
v. 302, facta facere, turbas turbare, somnium somniare, Sec.
