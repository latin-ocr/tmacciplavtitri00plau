sc. ιι] NOTES. 73

an unaccented long syllable Σελεύκεια to Seleucia as occurs in πλατεῖα
platea, χορεία chorea, βαλανεῖον balineum &c. But from v. 845 where
Seleucia is named with Macedonia, Asia and Arabia it is more probable
that the province Σελευκίς is meant, and used for Syria, like Persia for
Περσίς.

114. corruptum. B. corrumtum i.e. corrumptum, and so v. ²40
corrumpier. This nasalised form is like thensaurus, nanctus v. 63, and
finctum for fictum, Ter. Eun. 104.

115. credo haud crederet. Credo is parenthetical as ν. 61, and does
not affect the construction, ‘I trow he would not trust.' But Plautus is
fond of such phrases. Cf. Merc. 207 credo, non credet pater, Epid. 507
uolo scire si scis &c.‚ Shaks. K. J. 111. 1. 7 and 9 ‘ I trust I may not trust
thee, Believe 'me 1 do not believe thee, man.’ Crederet is imperf. subj.
where we should use plup. ‘he would not have trusted.’ See on ν.
133.

116. quid tu ⁴? an elliptic question used to prepare the way for and
call attention to a second question which it introduces. So v. 330 quid
is? egetne, Capt. 717 quid tu? una nocte postulauisti 3², Epid. 148 quid
tu ? nunc patierin ut ego me interimam ?

117. fide, here a dat„ and this form for the fifth declension gen.
and dat. is common. Livy, Sallust and even Cicero have often as gen„
, more rarely as dat„ such forms as acie, specie, fide, spe, die. Gellius
(Noct. Att. Ix. 14) quotes Caesar as saying that huius die and huius

specie ought to be the forms used, and mentions the theory that die,
specie ‘were abl. forms used as gen. : modern philologists have made them

loc.‚ like die crastini &c. In Plautus and Terence rei, spei &e. are
nearly always monosyllabic, fidei is always dissyllabic in Terence and
usually so in Plautus. Hor. C. 111. 7. 4 has constantis iuuenem fide.
See further on these forms Neue, Formenlehre 1. p. 379, Lindsay, L. L.
382 ff.

118. quin eum restituis Ἰ The object is adulescentem. But that
is put forward for emphasis and becomes an anticipatory accus„ so the
object is repeated in the pronoun eum. Cf. Asin. 527 illos qui dant, eos
derides, Cas. 655 tua ancilla, quam tu tuo uilico uis dare uxorem, ea
intus.

quin ad frug-em com-igis ⁴2 ‘ why don't you reform him to honesty? ’
—a short expression for conr-igis ut ad frugem redeat. Cf. Bacch. 1084

uiso ecquid eum ad uirtutem aut ad frugem opera sua compulerit.
119. 01 rei. Both words are scanned as monosyllables and rei is
elided. Perhaps re as v. 1 17. ea res is explained in the next line.
