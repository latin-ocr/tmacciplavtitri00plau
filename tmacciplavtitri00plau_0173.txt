sc. 1v.] NOTES. 129

di, uestram fidem, ‘ great heavens !’ Like pro di inmortales, v. 501,
never a real appeal to the gods for help, but, as Donatus says (Ter.
Andr. 716), ‘ admirantis aduerbium cum exclamatione! See on v. 160.

592. edepol re gesta pessume gestam probe, i.e. rem gestam
probe, ‘ really a fine success after a horrible mess‚’ i.e. though Lesboni-
cus has made ducks and drakes of the property, here is a good match
for his sister—if only we can keep the land. On the acc. of exclamation
after edepol see v. 128.

694. quid ea re fuat, ‘ though even now it is very doubtful what is
to become of it.’ For the constmetion see v. 157, and onfuat v. 267.

595. sed [id] si alienatur, ‘but if the land is conveyed ’ (to Lysi-
teles—see v. 557). Editors bracket icl or change to is in agreement with
ager, v, 593. But, though not needed, id may stand after ea re, ef. Aul.
770 ego te de alia re resciuisse censui, quod ad me attinet.

actumst de cono meo, ‘ it's all up with my neck,’ meaning properly
‘with my head‚’ ‘my life,’ but also, as appears from the next line,
referring to the burdens he must carry if he goes with Lesbonicus to
serve as a soldier. Lesbonicus, if he parts with the land, will be penni-
less. He must turn soldier.

596. peregre, ‘to foreign parts '= in Asiam aut in Ciliciam, v. 599.
See v. 149.

598. ibit istac aliquo, ⁴ he will go off somewhere in that direction
(by that road) to utter perdition, to serve as a soldier, either to Asia or
Cilicia.’ If istac is sound, it is used δεικτικῶς, pointing to the entrance
on the left of the spectators which leads to the harbour.

599. latrocinatum, supine after ibit. Latro=m600q56pos‚ ‘ a mer-
cenary,' latrocinari: μισθοφορεῖν. Cf. λάτρον, λατρεύειν. So Mil. 74
rex Seleucus me opere orauit maxumo, ut sibi latrones cogerem et con-
scriberem, ibid. 949 ut latrones quos conduxi hinc ad Seleucum duceret,
Poen. 663 hic latro in Sparta fuit, &c. The wars are the wars which
ensued on the death of Alexander the Great‚ and raged especially in the
dominions of the Seleucidae. In the New Attic Comedy the desperate
lover and the broken man are continually ‘off to the wars’ in Asia
Minor.

600. quo mihi imperat-,umam sc. ut irem, v. 577.

601. exturbauit nostris aed-ibus. So v. 805 cunctos exturba aedi-
bus, Aul. 70 extrudit aedibus, Merc. 357 domo extrusit.

Exit Stasimus. The pause between the Acts is filled up with the
music of the tibicen. Cf. Pseud. 573—the end of Act I.--tibicen uos
interibi hic delectauerit.
