and unguentS, and washed away in baths.' For the force of the preposi-
tions see on v. 250 and Roby, L. G. 1949. For the spelling comessum
cf. adessas, exessus, peressus δια, missi, messere, haus-serat, caussa &c.
and see Lindsay‚ L. L.‚ p. 112. The number of costly unguents, per·
fumes and so on, was enormous. The Romans not only anointed
themselves after the baths, but also persumed themselves sreely besides-

407. pistor: ‘ miller‚’ not ‘ baker,' in Plautus.

408. holitores‚ ‘ greengrocers.’ Holus, ἃς. is the better spelling, see
Lindsay‚ L. L.‚ p. 228, myropolae = μυροπῶλαι, aucupes, ‘ poulterers,’
‘ bird-sellers,' not here ‘ bird-catchers.’

409. minus goes with cito, dz'uorse with distrahitur, ‘it is not less
quickly torn to shreds,' lit. ‘torn apart in opposite directions.’ Cf.
Merc. 470 quo pacto ego diuersus distrahor and ν. 61 7, where dzstralzz'tur
is again used of the dissipation of property.

410. papauerum, ‘a ‘poppy,' the masculine is attested by Nonius
p. 220, occurs again Poen. 326, and is regular in ante-classical writers.
Cf. gutturem v. ¹014·

412. ibidem una. traho, ‘I put that in the same list,‘ see on
v. 203.

413. defrudaui B, defraudaui AC. But cf. frustra, frustrari and
see Ritschl, Parerg. p. 541. On em see v. 3, ratio: ‘account.' This
line is apparently too long, and is reduced to proper size by the omission
of quid, ego or istaec. This last is the only word which can be spared,
but it is doubtful whether it ought to be excised. Cf. Amph. 793 and
the lines quoted ad loc. by Leo.

414. non tibi illud apparere, si sumas, potest‚‘ it is impossible‚’
or ⁴ possible it is not for the money to be forthcoming, if you choose to
spend it, unless indeed you think that your money can’t die.' Non from
its position emphatically negatives the whole, as vv. 133, 1027, 1046,
1 153. sz' sumaszsi eo uti uelis.

416. These two lines are an ‘ aside' by Philto, who overhears the
conversation. The dialogue between Lesbonicus and Stasimus is not
interrupted by the lines, or by the similar ‘ aside ' vv. 422—424.

sero atque stulte qualify putat, the relative quod refers to rationem
putat and=ut rationem putet. In English it is be'st to make two
sentences, ‘ It is late and silly to take now the precaution he ought to
have taken at first. He first spends the money and then balances the
