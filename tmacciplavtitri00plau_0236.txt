1 92 T RJN VMM VS. [ACT v.

aperite hoc, as v. 870.

1175. lta. subitumst‚ propere quod eum conuentum uolo, ‘it is
such pressing business, on which 1 wish to see him at once.' Subitumst
or res subitan, ‘it is a pressing emergency,' as Cure. 302 ita res subi-
tast: celeriter mz' hoc homine conuentost opus, Aul. 272 subitumst nimis,
Mil. 225 hanc rem age: res sabaarim, Pers. 585 si tibi subiti nil est,
tantumdemst mihi.

1176. Lesbonicus comes out in answer to the summons. Some
editors begin a new scene with his appearance, but the MSS. join what
follows with the foregoing scene, and B gives the name of Lesbonicus
with the other speakers v. 1 125.

subito is rightly bracketed by Guietus.

1177. satine salue? ‘is all well with you?' As the terminations
e and ae are hardly distinguished in the Mss. it is easy to read here
satine saluae? sc. res, ‘is all well ?' a form of polite enquiry that occurs
Liv. 1. 58. 7, 111. 26, x. 18 ; but in the other passages of Plautus, Men.
776, Stich. 10, clearly the adv. is used, as also Ter. Eun. 978. An'd
the adv. goes better with the answer recte. Satine salue? then=satine
salue agitur ἓ to which the reply is recte (agitur) ‘it's all right,' recte being
applied to health as v. 50, but also doubtless retaining its usual force as
an evasive answer, intended to prevent any further enquiries. So Ter.
Haut. 518 quid tu ziz-tic (sc. agis)? Recte equidem, ‘ I'm an right‚’ Ad.
652 M1. quid est? ΑΕ. nil: recte: perge. So Lysiteles goes on at once
to his news.

1181. si quid tibi, pater, laboria—. The sentence is cut short by
Charmides' eagemess to relieve his son’s fears. It would be in full si
quid tibi laboris euenit, nollem (sactum), ‘if any trouble has besallen

· you, I'm sorry for it,' as Ter. Haut. 82 si quid laborat, nollem. Nollem

is a polite expression of regret, implying that the speaker would gladly
put things straight if only he could.

1182. ‘All's well that ends well.' Charmides has corne back safe
and prosperous‚ and is well satisfied to let his troubles rest—all he wants
now is his son's reformation-

Ritschl marks a gap here and supplies a couple of lines to shew
what he thinks is here required. But the arrangement that Lesbonicus
shall be married to Callicles’ daughter has been concluded between
the fathers indoors. Charmides merely announces it.

1183. haec tibi pactast Callicli filla. This is a syllable short.
We may correct by using another form of the gen. Calliclai‚ like
Charmidai ν. 359, or Callicletis on the analogy of Pericletis and Strato-
