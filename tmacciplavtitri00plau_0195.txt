ξ sc. ιιι] NOTES. 15 1
ξ tanta soli soleant credier. Less often trecenti is used in this sense, as
v. 964, Mil. 250, Pers. 410 and 668, or ducenti, as Truc. 341. ‘Three ’
is commonly used for a very small number, as v. 963 te tribus uerbis uolo,
‘just a word with you.'

⁷92. mum quem habuit. perdidit, alium post fecit nouom. This
is intended as a specimen of the excuses that might be invented.
‘ He lost the ring he had, he got another, a new one, made afterwards.’
But as it stands it is a ‘ monstrous ' line. If with N iemeyer we substi-
tute periit for perdidit, so that illum quem habuit periit is an attraction
like v. 985, a better line is got. But probably someone has been
shewing his ingenuity by inventing specimen excuses, and the line should
be cut out. Iam in v. 793 then has its proper force and place.

793. iam, ‘further.' Iam carries the argument a step forward.
There is no difficulty about the seal, the letters need not be sealed.

⁷94. apud portitores, ‘that his letters have been opened (unsealed)
and examined in the Customs.’ Portitores is Valla's correction to make
this verse accord with v. 810. The portitores were what we should call
Custom-House officers who collected the portorium, ‘harbour duty,’
v. 1107, from all arrivals. They could examine goods and open
letters. The officers in the original were the πεντηκοστολόγοι, so
called because they levied a duty of 2 p.c. i.e. ἐς on all imported
goods.

sim, ethic dat.-here dat. incommodi—not ei because the Syco-
phant may be regarded as the logical subject of dici lzoc potest.

796. seg-niues merast, ‘a mere doing nothing,' ‘a pure waste of
time.' Cf. Capt. 396 quae memini, mora merast monerier.

797. quamuis semones possunt longi tener, ‘ a tissue of talk can
be woven as long as you please! Quamuis with longi, see on v. 380.
With texier cf. μύθους ὑφαίνειν, Hom. 11. 111. 212.

798. confestim, an acc. sing. adv. from the root {fes-ti, of which
the verb festino indicates a by-form. Lindsay, L. L. p. 556. Clancu-
lum is apparently a diminutive of clam. The form is comic, and Terence
uses it as a preposition (Ad. 52 clanculum patres) governing the acc.‚ as
clam always does in Plautus and Terence. It is doubtful whether clam
ever governs the abl. See Langen, Beitrage p. 229. Clam is originally
an acc. sing. fem. adj. like coram, palam, perperam, promiscam.

799. ancillas, ‘maid-servants,' ‘handmaidens,’ is commonly used as
the fem. of seruos.

800. eampse=ipsana So vv. 950 eumpse, 974 eapse. Ipse is
*is-pse and occasionally both elements of the compound are declined
