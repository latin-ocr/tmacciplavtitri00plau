sc. v.] NOTES. 185

expect thensaurum, qui (or by attraction quae) dosfilz'ae tuae daretur, cf.
v. 1143: but by antiptosis (v. 373) dos is anticipated out of the relative
sentence and becomes acc. in apposition to thensaurum.

1102. em, ‘there'=‘see Ι arn here.' As Callicles has spoken of
the treasure, Charmides wishes to get Stasimus out of the way, so he
sends him off to the harbour. But Stasimus has already heard enough
to give him the clue to the mystery. The MSS. give hem, an interjec-
tion of terror, grief &c.‚ which is continually written in place of em, as
Asin. 335 and 431. Only the best MSS. like A and the Bembine of
Terence preserve em.

1103. unum cun-iculum face, ‘make one heat of it‚’ i.e. run on
without stopping till you get there. everriculum, lit. ‘a running' as here,
is generally used as a modal abl. with currere, uenire, acffizrre &c.=‘at
fun speed,' as Epid. 14 nam ut apud portum te conspexi, curriculo occepi
sequi. The mention of the Piraeus here is the only definite proof in the
play itself that Athens was the scene of the original. But it is a well-
known rule that Athens is always the scene unless the reverse is ex-
pressly stated in the Prologue‚ as Amph. 97, Rud. 32.

1105. sager-ionem. Sagario is the slave in charge on the ship.
Stasimus is to order him to see that the goods are duly landed as
directed, and he is to go with him (simul).

110⁷. portorium, see on v. 794.

1108. cito ambula, ‘go quickly.' Ambula is used of quite short
distances, so that sometimes it is little more than abi. Bene ambula-2·
‘bon voyage,' as Asin. 108 ἰ, bene ambula, Capt. 900 bene ambula et
redambula, and when a person returns bene ambulasti? or bene ambula-
tumst? The MSS. give BC moraciz‘, D moratii: morae cito is Ritschl’s‚
Taubmann suggests i, ἱ ambula like nise specta &c.‚ but cf. Pseud. 920

ambula ergo cito.
1109. ulie sum atque hic sum, ‘I am there and lo! I arn here

again,' i.e. Ι shall be back in no time, cf. Amph. 969 iam hic ero, quom
zllic censebis esse me, Pers. 190 sed ita uolo te ire, ut domi sis, quom ego te
esse illi censeam.

Charmides follows Callicles into the house.

1110. hic, pointing to Callicles' retreating figure. Stasimus has
heard enough to divine the truth.

1112, 1113. These two lines are disordered and incomplete in the

MSS. The arrangement in the text with the conjectural supplement of
v. 1113 comes from Hermann and Ritschl. The lines as given afford

the required sense and may be taken as substantially what Plautus wrote.
