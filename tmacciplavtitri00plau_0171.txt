se. 1v.] NOTES. 127

relative sentence by antiptosis, and the relative sentence is not strictly
dependent (actum est, not actum sit). See note on V. 373 and cf.
Capt. 206 scimus nos nostrum afficiam quod est. In Plautus the para-
tactic indic. is the ordinary use after familiar colloquial phrases such as
uide, uiden? audin? followed by ut, quo modo &c., e.g. Aul. 46 illuc
sis uide, ut incedit, Merc. 169 hoc sis uide, ut palpatur, Men. 920 audin
tu ut deliramenta loquitur? Pseud. 15² lzoc sis uide, ut alias res agunt.

579. gratulator, imperative. The termination is -tad with the final
dchanged to r. See Lindsay, L. L. p. 517.

scilicet, ‘without fai1.’ Sci-licet corresponds in sense to scire licet,
which Lucretius uses in full, at the same time employing scilicet as its
equivalent, e.g. 11. 469 scilicet esse globosa. The history of ilicet and
uidelicet is the same, and hence their use with acc. and infin„ e.g.
Cure. 263 ilem alios deos fizcturos scilicet, ‘you may be sure the other
gods will do the same,’ Capt. 469 ilicet parasiticae arti maxumam
malam crucem, ‘the profession of the diner-out may go and hang itself‚’
Asin. 599 esse negotzbsum interdius uidelicet Solonem, ‘you can see that
by day he is a busy Solon! See Munro on Lucr. 1. 210. The words
are formed directly from the verbal noun-stems, just as tenses are
formed. Sci-licet, i-licet, uide-licet are precisely analogous to sci-bo,
i-b0‚ uide-bo &c- Another less probable view derives the words from the
imperative, sci, licet =‘ know, you may. '

580. coram, ‘that the day may be fixed for the wedding in person,’
i.e. by a personal interview between you and Lysiteles.

581. eadem, ‘ at the same time,' always in Plautus with the fut. or
fut. perf. The phrase is given in full, eadem opera, ‘with the same
trouble‚' Asin. 640, Bacch. 60, Capt. 450, Most. 1039. Similar is una
opera, ‘just as well, ‘you might as well‚’ Asin. 99, Pseud. 319. But
una opera is also used in the same sense as eadem. Roby, L. G. 1237.

582. tu istuc cura. quod iussi ε ego iam hic ero, ‘ mind you see to
what I told you ε I’ll be back directly.' This is addressed to Stasimus
by Lesbonicus, and refers to his previous orders, vv. 577—579. The
line is defective ε it may be filled up by curato bene in place of cura, but
emendation is not necessary, for, as Leo says, the line has been added to
enable the rest of the scene to be omitted.

ego iam hic ero, ‘ I’ll be back here directly,' is regularly used by a
person just quitting the stage.

583. quin tu 1 modo—1 modo—abi modo. With Stasimus' haste

to get Lesbonicus to go, cf. Merc. 954, 955, where Charinus presses
Eutychus with i modo...z· modo...quin tu ergo i modo.
