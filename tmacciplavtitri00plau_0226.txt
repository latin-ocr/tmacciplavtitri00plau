182 TRJNVMMVS. [Aer ιν.

1076. nempe, as v. 196.

saluom et seruatum, emphasis by the use of two practically syno-
nymous words. See on v. 199.

1077. otiose, B adosse, see on v. 37.

1078. quo tu te agis? ‘whither sarest thou?’ ‘where are you off
to? ’ So Mil. 863 quo te agis? but Bacch. 1106 unde agis? without te.

1080. quid iam 7 ‘why do you say ‘now'?' ‘what do you mean by
‘now'?’ The word or words that occasion surprise are repeated by the
person perplexed, just as they were spoken, with quid? prefixed. Thus
Amph. 1021 M. quis adfores est? A. ego sum. M. quid ‘egv sum’?
what do you mean by ‘It's I'? Bacch. 147 omitte, Lyde, ac caue malo.
L. quid ‘caue malo’? Capt. 1006 salum, exoptate gnate mi. T. hem!
quid ‘gnate mi’? Rud. 736 numqui minus hasce esse oportet‘liberas?
L. quid ‘liberas’? Charmides, ignorant that Lesbonicus has sold the
house, is amazed to learn that they don’t live there, and in perplexity
repeats iam, the word with which Stasimus, probably slowly and hesi·
tatingly, had commenced an explanation.

1081. praesentatus argenti mirus numeratis, a continuation of the
previous sentence interrupted by perii, ‘ for money pajd down in cash.' ’
Numeratis as v, 965, praesentariz‘s ‘in ready money,' a Plautine word,
Most. 361 and 913.

1083. rem, ‘’property as v. 114, :bona v.1095.

1085. ponticulo, as v.194. But all through Lesbonicus seems to be
living in the house itself. In v. 390 Lysiteles tells his father that he
lives there, v. 401 Lesbonicus comes out of the house with his slave,
v. 1174 they go to the door of the house to summon Lesbonicus. See
Langen, Plaut. stud. p. 222. The explanation is, Ι take it, that the
stage arrangements could not shew the posticulum, and stage exigencies
required the street—door of the house to be the access to the posticulum.

1087. miserrumis periens, MSS. miserum meis periculis, and miser-
rumis is nearer than miser summis and other proposals that have been
made. Periclum is the normal form of the word in Plautus, periculum
occurs only at the end os the line, as Capt. 740 periclum uitae meae tuo
slat periculo.

1088. capitali periclo per praedones plurumos. This line does
not do much more than substitute the pirates for the seas on which they
plundered, and though per can be explained with its present construction,
it looks like a repetition of per in the previous verse. Leo makes two
lines, ego miserrumis pertz-lis quom per maria maxuma Ι me seruaui,
saluos redii, nunc lzic dez—perii miser. But to my mind quom spoils the
