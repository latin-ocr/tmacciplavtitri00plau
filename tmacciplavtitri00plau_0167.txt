Hence ad incitas-:ad summam rerum perturbationem desperationemque
redigi. Cf. Poen. 907 profecto ad incitas lenonem rediget, si eas (mulieres)
abduxerit. For such details of the games as are known see Dict. of
Antiq. s.v. Latruncnli.

539. nam fulguritae sunt alternae arbores. Places struck by
lightning were deuotae or infelices. The hiatus before arbores has led to
various changes. Ritschl wished to read alternas as nom. plur.! Spengel
suggests alternis, others insert illz' (see v. 530) between alternae and
arbores.

540. sues moriuntur angina, ‘the pigs die of quinsy.' Angi‘na
from ango, as pagina from pango. The line ends with acerrume. Acer-
rume mori is a strange expression. If we insert acri with Fleckeisen,
angina acri acerrume, ‘die of a violent quinsy most violently,’ perhaps
acerrume may be allowed to stand. Otherwise macerrumae (J. H.
Onions), ‘the pigs grow very lean and die of quinsy,’ is very tempting,
the more so as macer refers properly to animals.

541. oues scabrae sunt δια, ‘the sheep are mangy, and hairless,
see, as this hand of mine.' Haec, as v. 172.

542. tum autem Syrorum δια, ‘then again, though the Syrians
are the most enduring of men, there is not one of them who has ever
lived six months there.' The Syrians were tall, strong and enduring
slaves, and were in request to carry the lectica (lecticarii). See Iuv. Vl.
352, Mart. IX. 3. 11 and 22. 9. But even they could not, says Stasi-
mus, stand quite a short time (sex menses) on this pestilential farm.
For the war between Rome and Antiochus see Mommsen, Bk. 111.
ch. ix.

544. ita, ‘so true is it that,’ ‘so invariably do they all drop down
with sunstroke.' Solstitz‘alzlr morbuszcecptams, ‘sunstroke,’ rather than
‘midsummer fever.' On the force of ita see v. 29 and Langen, Beitrage
p. 2 31 ff. -

545. Campans genus. Stasimus thinks that in naming the Syrians
he has quoted the hardiest of men. Philto replies that he is ready to
believe what Stasimus says, but the Campanians are now far hardier
than the Syrians. The Campanians were effeminate and luxurious. As
a punishment sor their desertion of Rome in the Third Punic War they
were treated very severely, and a large number of them were sold as
slaves. They were now so accustomed to slavery that they were far
superior to the Syrians in endurance. See for the facts Mommsen,
Bk. 111. ch. vi. p. 190 ff. ‘When writers of comedy jested over the
sact that the Campanian serfs had already learnt to survive in that deadly
