780. tenes ‘2 in the same sense as teneo v. 667.

propemodum. The MSS„ except F, give propemodo. But this
later form is not used by Plautus. See on v. 615.

781. tum igitur, see v. 676. demum dabis, ubi, ‘you will at last
give, when '=‘ you will only give when.’ The old form demus is net
needed here, as hiatus is permissible after tu, see Introduction, p. xxii.

783. scite, as scitum v. 764. hoe, abl. ⁴ thereby,’ ‘ by doing
this.'

⁷84. suspicionem ab adulescente amouens, ‘ you will remove
suspicion from the young fellow,’ i.e. prevent Lesbonicus from becoming
suspicious.

787. hoc aetatis, ‘ although at my age I am ashamed to act the
sharper,' ‘to play the part of a sycophant,’ by so deceiving Lesbonicus.
lzoc is adv. acc. of limitation and aetatis partitive gen. Cf. id aetatis
(Asin. 71), illuc aetatis (Mil. 659), istuc aetatis (Mil. 618), quid tibi ego
aetatis uideor? (Merc. 290), scio ego quid sim aetatis (Pers. 276), nemo
id auctoritatis aderat (Tac. Ann. ΧΗ. 18). So hoc noctis, id tem·
poris, &c.

788 b. A manifest dittographz‘a of 788 a.

789. nonne arbitratis eum adulescentem anun paterna signum
nosse ¹? The connexion with what precedes is loose. The sentence
begins, ‘but when the hired fellow shall bring the letters signed and
sealed.’ It should continue, ‘how is he to convince Lesbonicus that
they are genuine?’ or ‘he will be unable to prove their genuineness)
Instead of this there is a direct question addressed to Megaronides,
‘ don’t you think Lesbonicus knows the seal (the impress) of his father’s
ringP’ Nonne is unusual in Plautus, it is used for non, like anne for an,
only before vowels. Spengel would write non in all places. Nonne for
non, arbitraris instead of the common arbitrare, nosse in place of the
more usual nouisse, though each separately is defensible, are all three
together rather curious.

790. etlam tu taces ‘1 ‘will you hold your tongue Ρ ’ See on v. 514.
Megaronides is impatient with Callicles for raising a difficulty which can
so easily be overcome.

791. sescentae, ‘any number of excuses can be got together to
meet that difficulty.’ Sescenti -ae -a, declined as a plur. adj. as ducenti,
trecenti, is for *se(c)s-cent2· like disco for *di(c)-sc0‚ see Lindsay, L. L.
p. 310. Sescenti is regularly used in Latin for an indefinitely large -
number, Aul. 320 sescenta sunt quae memorem, si sit otium, Bacch. ¹034
sescenta tanta reddam, si uiuo, tibi, Pseud. 632 quasi mihi non ses-emta
