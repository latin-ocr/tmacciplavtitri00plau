phonetic law that final d was lost after a long vowel. Med, ted, sed are
probably abl. of the pers. pron. used as acc. See Miiller, Handbuch 11².
p. 345, Lindsay, L. L. p. 421. It is necessary to read med, for rei is
apparently spondaic only before consonants.

231. utra in parte, ‘on which side (i.e. on the side of love or the
side of money) there is more pleasure for living one's span of life, this
is a point on which I am not quite clear.’ The order of the words is
plus uoluptatis sit ad aetatem uitae agundam. Cf. Amph. 633 satin
parua res est uoluptatum in uita atque in aetate agunda ?

233. hau is used for haud only before consonants, e.g. hau scio, but
baud habeo: the unusual order satis hau for haud satis gives more
emphasis to both words, as Aul. 231 tu me bos magis haud respicias,
gnatus quasi numquam siem.

niel hoc sic faciam, opinor, ‘ only, I think, I'll do this.’
Nisi =‘only,’ ellipfically, ‘it is not clear, except (it is clear),’ as with
nescio nisi, ‘I don't know, except (Ι know),‘ e.g. Rud. 750 praeffecto
nescio: nisi scio probiorem hanc esse quam te, Pseud. 1 102 non edepol
scio: nisi opseruemus quo eat, Cic. pro Rosc. Am. 99 nescio: nisi hoc
uideo, &c.

234. ut follows sic and explains what he proposes to doz ‘I'll do
this, I'll consider well both courses together, act as judge and arraigned
person sor the purpose.' ludex, because he will decide between amor
and res3 reus, because he will shape his life according to the decision⁴
given.

236. expediant, ‘ develope,’ ‘run their course'; expedire is used
absolutely, as Amph. Prol. 5 ut res nostrorum omnium bene expedire
uoltis, ibid. 521 nequiter paene expediuz't prima parasilatio. See Langen,
Beitr'age, pp. 1-3.

237 b. postulat, ‘expects' Postulare in comedy= ἀξιοῦν. It may
be followed either by acc. and infin„ as here se conicere, or by the simple
infin. as v. 972. Love is personified as a hunter trying to entangle the
game in the toils.

As cupidum hominem refers to a class of men rather than any
individual, we have v. 238 the plur. eos. Cupidum...cupit is an
intentional assonance, ‘lusts sor the lustful‚’ ‘has a passion for the
passionate.’

238. subdole ab re consulit, ‘ Love counsels them crastily against
their interest-⁷

ab re, ‘away from the interest of,' i.e. ‘contrary to the interest of,’
must be caresully distinguished from ex re=in rem, ‘sor the interest of,'
