likely to be short here cdcalam, more likely caelant, ⁸ sor cacula repre-
sents an earlier cacla, not cacola.' See Lindsay in Class. Rev. VI. 3,
p. 89.

722. ut=ubi, at B, aut CD.

conioxit, fut. perf.-sigmatic aorist form coniec-sit. See on v. 60.
The editors who give coniexit take it as perf. subj„ i.e. as the optative,
not the subj. of the sigmatic aorist. Leo reads ad aliquem regem in
saginam erus sese coniciet meus. But if we read ut, ‘when‚' and take
coniexit as fut. perf., i.e. take it as 3rd pers. from coniexo, like faxo,
capso, occepso δια, not coniexz'm, the structure corresponds exactly with
quom...sumpsero below.

ln saginam, ‘to be fattened,’ for only poverty drove him to enlist.

723. fugitorem fore. The whole point of the line depends on the
- παρὰ προσδοκίαν ending. And so lines 724 and 726. ‘I believe that
compared with the mightiest warriors he will be first-rate—in ssight’-
fugitorem παρὰ προσδοκίαν for pugnatorem, ‘in flight’ for ‘in fight.’
Not only Aristophanes and Plautus, but also Hood, Dickens and
others depend largely on these unexpected turns for their effects. E.g.
‘’Twas there he left his second leg, And the Forty Second Foot.' ‘Like
an ardent warrior, Mr Pickwick sprang from his tent—bedstead.'
There is an excellent example ‘Love’s Labour's Lost,' 1. 1. 2 30 ff. For
other unexpected endings cf. v. 992, Asin. 42, 625, 886, Aul. 672,
Bacch. 505, Cure. 562, Most. 253 and 1007, Truc. 348. ad, ‘in com-
parison with,’ as Capt. 275 (Thales) ad sapientiam liuius nimius nugator
suit.

724. et capturum...uenent, ‘and will win spoils there--the man
who confronts my master will.’ Aduersus as interpellatio v. 709, taber-
naculo v. 726, sagittas v. 72 5.

726. dormibo placide ln tabernaculo, ‘when I have fully armed
myself—I will sleep peacefully in my tent.’ quom extemplo v. 24²·
Unless hiatus is allowed after placide, the line is a syllable short.
Perhaps Ritschl's placidule should be read.

727. nudius sextus, ‘now the sixth day ’= ‘ five days ago.’ Nudius
is nz'c' (viil-l-dius, Ind.-Eur. *d(z·)yeus‚ ‘the sky‚' ‘day.’ So nudius
tertius, ‘the day before yesterday,' nudius quartus, ‘three days ago’ &m

728. reposcam, ‘ I will demand repayment from the man to whom,
five days ago, I gave a friendly loan of a talent‚’ reposcam sc. eum, quoi
&c. Dare mutuom, ‘to give as a friendly loan,’ )( dare faenore, ‘to lend
at usury.’ ’

uiaticum, ἐφόδια, ‘travelling money.’ All this is a bit of bounce.
