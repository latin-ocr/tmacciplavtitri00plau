sc. 1v.] NOTES. 121

take it as an adv. abl. ‘secretly,’ ‘privately,’ as Cic. Att. XVI. 3 lzunc

(librum) lege arcano conuiuis tuis.

519. crede, ‘entmst‚’ as v. 145.

520. dico does not govern ne siris, the ne clause is not dependent.
Siris=siueris perf. subj. of sino, so sirit, siritis, sirint. ‘N ever allow
that farm to become your property or your son’s.'

522. ei rel argumenta dicam. Ei and rei are both monosyllables
by synizesis, so that rei is entirely elided. The whole phrase occurs
Most. 92.

523. nnn...quom=ill0 tempore quom, ‘at the time when.' Olim
is from the same stem as the old Latin ollus (ille=0lle) and means
properly ‘at that time,' then came to mean ‘at any former time‚' ‘once
upon a time‚’ and finally ‘at any time.' In its original meaning olim is

‚ used in Plautus as here with quom, e.g. Mil. 2 olim quom sudumst,

Truc. 65 olim quom caletur maxume. The term. —im in olim has
perhaps not yet been explained. It has been supposed to be an instru-
mental sing. in olim, interim, altrim (as Pseud. 357 assiste altrim secus),
see Miiller, Handbuch 112. p. 344, Giles, Manual of Comp. Phil. 326 v.

524. in quincto quoque sulco. The spelling of A, quincto, is
retained. Merc. 66 B has quicto for quincto. The c in this word
remained long after the time of Plautus. And so in the proper name,
‘Quinctus is the spelling of the Republic, Quintus of the Empire.’ See

Lindsay, L. L. p. 70.
525. apage. See on v, 2 58. It is best to change the MSS. nostro

to uestro, and give the whole line to Philto. Tum at the beginning of
the next verse is understood most naturally as a resumption of his story
by Stasimus. Acheruntis ostium, because any unhealthy or pestilential
spot was thought to be an entrance to the lower world. On the scansion
of Acheruns see v. 494.

526. tum uinum, prius quam coctumst, pendet putidum, ‘then
again the grapes hang rotten (or ⁴ withered’) before they have ripened.’
Vinum by metonymy for uua, as was noted by Porphyrio on Hor. C. 1.
20. 10 ‘pro uino uuam posuit (Horatius) : μετωνυμία, τρόπος. ffltic con-

trarium Plautus in Trinummo fecit, uinum pro uua dicens)
527. This line and a half is an aside by Lesbonicus, who is fatuous

enough to think that ‘Stasimus is strongly advising the sellow’ to accept

the proffered dowry.
528. at stands emphatically at the beginning of the apodosis‚

‘although he is a rascal, still &c.’ So Capt. 684.
529. pontid stands regularly at the beginning of a line, just as postea
