and a dinner, but again he ends παρὰ προσδοκίαν, ‘may the gods con·
found you, if I care a straw whether you had perished before you came
here.' An, used iu a simple indirect question, as Cure. 396, Merc. 145,
Poen. 557. Si te flocci facio, antiptosis, as v. 373.

993. te macto infortunio, ‘I devote you to disaster‚’ as Amph.
1034, Bacch. 364, Cure. 537.

994. floccum non interdum, ‘ matters to me not one straw‚’ lit. ‘ I
would not give a straw between,’ the one alternative is as indifferent to
me as the other. So Rud. 580 eluas tu an exungare, ciccum non inter-
dm'm. For the form z'nterduim‚ see on vv. 6 and 436.

995. ibo, ad mum renuntiabo. Cf. Stich. 598 iuben domi cenam
coqui atque ad illum renuntiari?

996. male uiue et uiue, ‘ bad life and bad luck to you‚' a parody of
the usual bene. Male belongs to both words.

997. qu1=utz'nam‚ v. 923, peregre, ‘ from abroad‚' ν. 149. Exit the
Sycophant, back to the Forum (right).

SCENE 3 (998—1007). This is not really a new scene. Charmides,
seriously alarmed at what has passed, soliloquises in Iambic Trimeters.

998. postquam...post‚ vv. 417 and 975. Illic hinc abiit is a
regular formula, usually to begin the line, in which illic is a pyrrhic; ille
is only used in the forms in which quidem occurs, as Truc. 884 ille
quidem hinc abiit. Cf. Capt. 751, Epid. 81, Pers. 200, Poen. 917 &c.

1000. iam dudum, vv. 608 and 923, ‘sor some little time! Ille
refers to what is coming, viz. the next line.

1002. epistula. ma. There were two letters, ν. 894. But it is
pedantic simply on that account to correct, as Meier does, epistulae illae...
concenturiant.

concenturiat, ‘ marshals.' So Mil. 815 si centuriati bene sunt mani·
plares mei, Pseud. 572 dum concenturio in corde sycophantias, one of
Plautus’ numerous military metaphors.

1003. et illud mille nummum, sc. concenturiat metum, ⁴ and so do
the thousand pieceS.’ For mille nummum see on v. 425. Sycophanta
is the subj. to agat.

1004. numquam edepol temere tinnit tintinnabulum, ‘ a bell
never rings (a tinkler never tinkles) for nothing.' Tinnio, tintinno and
tintinnio are onomatopoetic words: numquam temere, ‘never sor
nothing,' i.e. without some reason, as v. 740. The whole line is pro—
bably a version of a popular proverb.

1005. nisi qui=nisi quis, ‘ unless someone.' See vv. 257 and 439.
