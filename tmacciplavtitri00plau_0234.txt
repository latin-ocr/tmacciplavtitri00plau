190 Τ RIN VMM VS. [ACT v.

descript. gen. after Philippum, ‘Philips of gold‚'=‘gold Philips‚' and
dotis is gen. aster the whole expression mille Philippum auri, ‘of dowry'
= ‘by way of dowry,’ as Pers. 394 dabuntur dotis tibi inde sescenti logi,
Ter. Haut. 838 porro haec (minae) talenta dotis adposcunt duo, ‘two
talents of dowry’; but for this gen. a predic. dat. is substituted‚ Ter.
Haut. 94² me mea onmia bona doti dixisse illi, Roby, L. G. 1 162.

dotem nil moror, as v. 297.

1159. si ma. tibi placet, placenda. dos quoquest quam dat tibi,
‘if you like the girl, you must also like the dowry she brings you.’ On

r the use of placenda see v. 264, Roby, L. G. 11. lxxviii.

1160. quod uls non duces, nisi illud quod non ms feres, ⁴ you
shall not take home what you want, unless you carry with her what you
don' t w ant’: quod ms: uxorem, quod non uis: dotem; ducere' is technical‚

‘to lead home a wife,' and ducere refers to living persons, ferre to inani-
mate objeets, like ἄγειν )( φέρειν. ·

1161. ius hic orat, ‘his suit is fair? substituted for aequom orat,
i. e. dicit, for the sake of the legal colour of ius which introduces impe·
trabit te aduocato atque arbitro, ‘ he shall win his suit, with you to back
and support him.' Aduocatus= ‘witness’ 3 it gets the sense of patronus
only in much later Latin: arbiter, see v. 146. Lysiteles answers as if
he were praetor, and the whole two sentences are a playful allusion to
the praetor's court, as Epid. 25, ΤΗ. ius dicis (=(1) aequom oras,
(2) administer justice). ΕΡ. me decet. TH„ taking ius dicis in second
sense, iam tu autem nobis praeturam geris? For the use of orare,
a common meaning in old Latin, cf. Amph. prol. 34 nam iusta ab iustt's
iustus sum orator datus, Capt. 333 optumum atque aequissumum oras.
Cf. also Stich. 726 bonum ius dicis: impetrare oportet qui aequom
postulat.

1162. istae lege, ‘on that condition‚’ ‘on the terms you mention‚’
i.e. ut dotem accipiam. Sponden..‚spondeo...sponde0, see on v. 500,
Curc- 674, Capt. 179.

1163. adfines, Callicles being included with Charmides, see v.
1 1 5 3.

1164. atque edepol, ‘and yet indeed’; the sense is adversative,
and the two words are used together to pass to a new subject, as Cure.
571, Men. 385, Pers. 451 and 697, Pseud. 784, ¹0²3 and 1050.

quas propter, see on v.· 822. ιωοιιεὸμως, ‘all the same‚' i.e.
‘although I let them pass and confirm the betrothal.’

eneconem, the genuine Latin form, sus- is for subs, as in sus-tineo,
susque, deque διο.
