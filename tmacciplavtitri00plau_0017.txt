INTROD UCTJON. xiii

did not last long, and was incapable of reproduction save in a
democracy like the Athenian. The New Comedy from its
simplicity, its interest depending on character-sketching, exciting
situations and developments, was specially suitable for trans-
plantation from Athens to Rome. The brilliant period of the
N ew Comedy at Athens was the half-century that followed the
death of Alexander the Great, its great lights were Menander,
Philemon, Diphilus. As we have seen, Liuius Andronicus
introduced this Comedy at Rome first 240 B.C., was followed by
Naeuius who like him wrote Tragedies also ; then came Plautus,
Caecilius, and Terentius who exclusively devoted themselves to
comoedia palliata. In fruitfulness of production‚ independent
use of his Greek originals, power of language, lively delineation
of character, readiness and wit, Plautus stands first of all the
Roman comedians1.

Gellius (111. 3) states that 130 pieces passed under Plautus'
name. Seruius says in the introduction to his Commentary on
the Aeneid-——‘ Plautus is said by some to have written 21 plays,
by others 40, by others 1003 The large numbers in these
estimates no doubt include some early plays by unknown authors
under the name of Plautus. Varro, who first treated the subject
in anything of a critical spirit, enumerates 21 plays as ascribed
to Plautus in all the lists (iudices), all of which we possess except
the Vidularia, which was lost between the 6th and 11th centuries
A.D. These are the Fabulae Varronianae. In a second class
Varro places the plays which were set down to Plautus in most
of the lists. This class probably included 19, which with the
21 undoubted comedies would give the 40 of Seruius' second
estimate.¹ Outside the 21 undisputed plays we know the titles
only of 32. The extant plays are given in the ordinary MSS. in
the following order: Amphitruo, Asinaria, Aulularia, Captiui,
Curculio, Casina, Cistellaria, Epidicus, Bacchides, Mostellaria,

Menaechmi, Miles Gloriosus, Mercator, Pseudolus, Poenulus,
Persa, Rudens, Stichus, Trinummus, Truculentus. This order

is alphabetical but takes account only of the initial letter
in the titles3 the one case where the initial letter is neglected
