1053, 1054. The two lines are bracketed by Bergk. They seem to
be introduced as an expansion and explanation of v. ¹05²·

mage for mag-is like pote, potis, v. 352, ‘if you begin to press harder
for payment.’ Magis, which is the adv. corresponding to the compar.
maior, is properly *ma(lz)2·s and takes its g from magnus, as figura
(fffilzura) from fingo. The suffix -is is a weak grade of the compar.
suffix -ios, but this ·z's was confused by the Romans with the nom. sing.
of facilis, potis δια, so that from magis, regarded as nom. sing. m. and
f., was formed a neuter mage, asv pote from potis. By a similar confusion
satis, a noun meaning ‘sufficiency,’ developed a neuter *sate, curtailed
to sat. Lindsay, L. L. p. 588.

1055. meus est hicquldem Stasimus seruos. Charmides coming
nearer, or looking at him more closely, recognises the speaker as his own
slave.

1056. talentum. This is the same piece of ‘bounce’ as he uttered
v. 727. A talent would be an enormous sum for a slave to have to lend,
and Stasimus talks about the transaction in quite a cool way as if
he often did the like. Vv. 1053, 1054, if they are allowed to stand, very
greatly impair the force of this sentence.

1057. insipientlor &c., v. 936.

rebus curem publicis, ‘meddle with affairs of state.’ Curo in old
Latin takes the dat., like consulo rei alicui, as often as the acc„ Rud.
146 tritico curat Ceres, Truc. 137 tuo uestimento et cibo alienis rebus curas.

1058. potius quam, id quod proxumumst, meo tergo tutelam
geram, ‘rather than, the point that touches me most closely, take care
of my back.' T utelam gerere as v. 870, i.e. save it from a thrashing‚
v. 1009. Χ

1059. On hearing Stasimus' intention of returning home, Charmides
comes forward and calls to him. Leo divides the words differently.
CH. Heus tu, asta ilico, audi. ST. heus tu, non sto, where Stasimus’
heus tu is a mocking echo of Charmides’.

asta inco, vv. 608 and 627: te uo1o, v. 516, ‘1 want you! But
Stasimus replies, ‘What if I don’t want you to want me?’

1060. nimium swuster, sc. dicis or agis. Saeuiter is one of the
many second declension adverbs formed with -ter. Plautus is fond of
these forms in -ter and uses them alongside of the forms in ·e. Thus
saeue and saeuiter, auare and auariter, blande and blanditer, firme and

firmiter &c. Saeuiter, Pseud. 1290, Poen. 335.

1061. emere meliust quoi imperes, ‘you’d better buy some one to
order about,’ i.e. I'm not your slave, don’t order me. Stasimus has not
