66 TRJNVMMVS. [ACT 1.

of the question ut uales, ‘ how are you?’ but puts the same question
himself. ’

But the hiatus at' the caesura is legitimate, αεᾳκαίίεεστυνέφηβος, cf.
v. 326, and is perhaps playful, addressed by one old man to another, and

the disregard of the question is not strange as the two greet and
question one another almost simultaneously.

50. ualen? i.e. ualesne? So uin=uisne v. 59, scin=scisne,
uiden=uidesne, satin=satisne &c- Plautus does not use nonne, which
is replaced by satin or simple -ne.

ualeo, et ualui rectius, ‘I am well, and Ι have been better.’ But
Brix refers rectius to ualeo as well as ualui, and understands it as satis
bene, ‘ I am and have been pretty well.' Recte is used of health, as Pers.
503 ego ualeo recte, hence rectius=melz'us.

51. plus quam ego u010,2 ‘stronger than I wish.' Cic. ad Att. ιν.
14· 1 has the opposite, quod minus ualuisses. Such jests on women,
wives and marriage are a staple with the writers of the New Comedy
and are reproduced with zest by Plautus. See Introduction and note on
Asin. 19.

52. bene herclest, ‘'gad, I’m delighted.' bene est=ev ἔχει, καλῶς
ἔχει, and so optume est, subjective, ‘I am glad,’ but optumum est,
objective‚ ‘capitaL' Cf. Capt. 699 bene est, Capt. 706 optumest, but
Aul. 237 and Asin. 786 optumum est. tibi, dat. incom„ ‘to plague
you.’

53. mali, partitive gen. aster sz' quid, as in hoc boni, id mali and
the like. '

55. eho tu, used to call a person's attention before asking a
question or issuing a command. Before a question eho an denotes
generally angry surprise or derision, e.g. vv. 934 and 942. A word
rarely inter-venes between eho and an as v. 986 eho, quaeso an.

57. uitae tuae superstes suppetat, ‘that she may outlast and
outlive you.’ The dat. uitae tuae depends both on superstes and
suppetat, and the effectiveness of the phrase is increased by the
alliteration. suppetat=‘be supplied t0,’ ‘be sufficient for,’ as Asin. 56
non suppetunt dictis data. Cf. Pers. 331 ut mihi supersit, suppetat,
superstite& where there is the same alliteration.

58. dumquidem hercle. Scan dam qui‘d' he‘rclle and cf. potest
v. 80, is ἔπ’ ν. 354, lze‘rcle v. 559, &c. ‘ Provided she were married to
you, I should assuredly have no objection.' Plautine pres. subj. of the
unsulfilled condition. Cf. Asin. 188. Sane with uelim is concessive.

60. faxo haud tantulum dederis uerborum mihi, ‘I'll warrant
