that the word may be used here* to denote the srrxjall amount of life we
have, ‘little measure,' ‘brief span' or the like. unless W& suppose
*hiatus after salillum, the line is a syllable short. This may 'be rectified
by reading animai, for which form see v. 359. Quom extemplossdrel
τάχιστα, ‘see v. 242. There are many suggested corrections of salinum,
e g. sthellum stalagmium, scintillula, uatillum (= batillum, ‘pan'’) It
is, I think, an objection to these proposals that they stand m appositinn
to homunculi, ‘we poor mortals the urn of lise, the pan of life' &ac- (i. e.
‚humanity is represented as the casket—or whatever ·it may-be-—th'at
contains life), and their adoption involves the change of qui tequam* to

are reckoned at the same reckoning, are valued at the same valuafion,

mortub's nom. sing. masc. agreeing, like the verb censetur, with the nearest
subject, viZ. opulentus-simus. Ad Acheruntem=apud Acheruntem. (The
first syllable of Acheruntem is scanned long. In words borrowed from
Greek by early Latin writers the aspirate was usually lost. Thus
Plautus puns upon Charinus, i.e. Carinus, and careo Pseud. 7 36‚· and
upon Thales, i.e. Tales, and talentum, Capt. 274. But in some cases the
vulgar Greek pronunciation of χ as k-klz operated so far as to lengthen
by position the preceding vowel of borrowed words in popular use.
Such instances are Z cherum as if Ac-clzeruns‚ chzz'lles, brachium and
trz‘cae (τρίχες). See Lindsay, L. L. pp. 57, 58.
