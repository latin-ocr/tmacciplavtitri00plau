ηομ] NOTES. 59

3. adest, sc. finis itineris or sequendi.

em, ‘ there.' Em may be the imperative of e‘mo, lit. ‘ take‚' a sense ·

which suits well in phrases like em tibi, ‘take that ’ (in giving a blow)
as Asin. 431 em ergo lcoc tibi, or it may be the adverbia} accus. of is,
which in old Latin is em, also perhaps properly spelt im. With this
line cf. Merc. 313 si umquam uz'dzlvtz's pictum amatorem, em illic est.
Joined with ille, em gives ellum, ellos just as ecce gives eccillum, eccillos
&c. Em as an interjection is not elided before illae.

nunciam scanned as a trisyllable: so etiam and quoniam. Brix
derives it from nunci (cf. νυνί) -l- the adverbial ending am. The distinc-
tion between nunciam and iam nunc is that nunciam refers to the
immediate present and future ‘in a minute,’ ‘ directly,' iam nunc to the
past and present ‘ now already.²

Inopia enters the house. Luxuria turns and addresses the spec-
tators. ,

4. erret, a metaphor from straying from the right path amplified
and continued in deducam in uiam, while that the phrase is meta-
phorical is shewn by the addition of paucis, ‘ in a few words.'

δ. operam dare, ‘to give me your attention '=audz're. So Capt.
Prol. 6 id ego hic apud uos proloquar, si operam datis. The bare infin.
instead of acc. and infin. (uos dare). Cf. v. 956.

N otice dare not uos daturos esse, i.e. pres„ not fut. infin.‚ after pro-
mittitis. This use of the pres. instead of the fut. infin. is common in
Plautus and old Latin after such verbs as promitto, spero, uoueo, minor,
iuro, dico, nego and the like. Cf. v. 755 dotem dare si dixerim,
v. 736 &c.

6. siet is even in Plautus’ time archaic‚ and the forms siem, sies,
siet are regularly used only at the end of the line. The old Latin siem,
classical sim (εέσίηιέεἴην), is properly an optative form, as are possim,
edim, uelim, duim, perduint, &c., and some -a forms as creduam. Cf.
v. 102 comedis.

7. huc, pointing to the house which Inopia has entered.

8. nomen Luxuriae indidit. By the regular attraction Luxuriae is
dat. the case of mihi, as in est milii nomen Balbo (not Balbus) and Asin.

Prol. 10 huic nomen Graece Onagost fabulae, where Onago is dat. by the
same attraction. By nomen indidit we are to understand, not that
Plautus invented the scene, but that he has given Τρυφή and Ἀπορία of
the original their Latin names.
9. Spengel, to avoid the hiatus, proposes tum lzanc autem=6’ αὖ.
10. introierit should be written as one compound word. For thus
