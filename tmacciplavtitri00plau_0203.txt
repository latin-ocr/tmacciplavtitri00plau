owner’-quz‘d mercede& petasus leodic domiuo detzzeret? Pers. 159, S. πόθεν
ornamenta? T. abs chorago sumito ; dare debet: praebenda aediles locaue-
runt, Cure. 464 where a choragus is afraid he will never recover the
ornamenta lent to a nugator. So choragium Capt. 61 is ‘stage-
properties‚’ ‘wardrobe.' suo periculo, so that he will have to replace
the costume if the Sycophant fails to return it.

859. circumducere, ‘to swindle.' So v. 9593 see on v. 616. All
the verbs there mentioned are synonyms of spoliare aliquem aliquo, and
take the same construction.

860. dabo operam...sentiat‚ ‘I shall be doing my best to make
him see that I by myself really am a sycophant,' me ipsum, ‘in and by
myself‚' without any instructions from him (v. 854) how to play the
part.

861. quam magis specto, minus placet=qu0 magis specto, eo minus
placet. Cf. Asin. 158 quam magis...tam, Bacch. 1076 quam magis...
magis, Men. 95 quam magis...tanto. Plautus does not use quo—ea.

mira. sunt nl and mirum est nz' with indic. and not ironical, see on
v. 495, ‘it is a wonder...if not’=‘I arn pretty sure...z's.'

862. dormitator here and v. 984 is taken to mean ‘thief‚’ a man
who sleeps by day that he may wake by night. Cf. Hesiod, Works 605
μή ποτε· σ’ ἡμερόκοιτος ἀνὴρ ἀπὸ χρήμαθ’ ἕλοιτο.

sector zonarius, βαλαντιοτὸμος, ‘cut-purse'; ‘ qui zonas nummorum
plenas secat.’ Zonarlus should be spelt senarius (see on v, 4² 5), as z was
not in use in Plautus’ day. But the MSS· often reflect the spelling of a
later date, as in trapezitae v. 4² 5, Syrorum v, 542 διο.

863. contemplat, non-deponent, see on v. 422: circumspectat se v.
146. Noscitat‚ ‘is taking stoek of.'

864. quo mox furatum ueniat, ‘he is reconnoitring the locality,
that he may come to steal later on.' Cf. Rud. 111 an quo furatum
uenias, uestzggas loca ?, ibid. 417 acczspiam hospitio, sz' mox uenies uespen‘.

865. mag-le, sc. quam antea, see v. 841. lubidost=lubet as ν. 626.

866. regiones, ‘quarter.'

868. habet rectam uim, ‘he is making straight for.' So Mil. 491,
Pseud. 1 1 36.

869. agttandumst uigilias, ‘on my arrival at home I shall have to
keep watch to-night.’ This gerund construction is usual in early and
some very late writers. Similarly Lucretius’ aeternas quoniam poenas
in morte timendumst, and even with verbs which do not take an acc. as
imperandum est seruis. In the classica} period the gerundive is pre-
ferred when the verb governs an acc„ e.g. Caesar and Cicero would say
