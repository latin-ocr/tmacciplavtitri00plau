1145· neu qui rem- ipsam posset intellegere, ‘and might not in
any way be enabled to understand the true state of the case, viz. that
your treasure was in my possession.’ Qui is abl. of the indefinite, as it
is in siqui and numqui.

114⁶. me esse penes, anastrophe, as v. 822, and separated from its
case, as Aul. 654 neque tui me quicquam inuenisti penes.

eum me lege populi patrium posceret, ‘legally demand the treasure
from me as being his father's property.’ Eum=tlzensaurum‚ MSS. a me,
but posco takes a double acc. and is never constructed by Plautus with
a me and the like.

1147. scite edepol, sc. factum, see v. 127, accus. of exclamation,
‘ cleverly planned indeed !’

hoc, with commentust, ‘ hit upon this device.’ Beneuolens, as v. 46.

1148. quin, ‘nay, 1‚’ like v. 932 quin dzlscupio dicere, ‘nay‚ I'm
bursting to tell you.'

1152. <li dent tibi, Lysiteles, quae uelis, cf. v. 436.

1153. non ego sum dig-nus salutis? ‘don’t I deserve a greeting?'
Callicles claims a greeting as having been the girl's guardian and
consponsor in the betrothal, and he is included as a member of the
family by Lysiteles in v, 1163. Nonius, p. 497, quotes the line in the
form dignus salutis, ‘ genetiuus positus pro ablatiuo.’ The genitive is
perhaps a Graecism and colloquial, but many adjectives that in later
Latin take abl. only, in Plautus take gen. or abl„ e. g. plenus, as Poen.
255 uenustatis plenum, and in the next line, Poen. 256 dignum Veneri
pol (MSS.) should perhaps be dignum Veneris. Cf. Cic. ad Att. VIII.
15 A. 1 suscipe curam et cogitationem dzgmksimam tuae uirtutis. But
Leo retains the MSS. salute dignus.

1154. tunica. propior pallient. ‘ Ut tunica corpori propior quam
pallium est, ita socerum ceteris amicis propiorem uideri dicit-⁹ Ussing.
A similar proverb is quoted from Theocr. XVI. 18 ἀπωτέρω ἢ γόνυ
κνάμα, ‘the calf is further off than the knee,’ in the sense ‘charity begins
at home.’

1155. uomere, trans„ as v. 502.

1156. nisi tu nouis, ‘unless you have some objection.’ Neuis for
nonnis, v. 328, Cure. 82, Merc. 150, and often, ne being used as the old
direct negative in a compound, as it is in nescio, neuter, nequaquam, &c-

Cfifssg'· 21813118 auri Philippum dotis, lit. ‘a thousand of Philips of
gold of a dowry'=⁴a thousand Philippes d'or as a dowry.' Philippum
is short gen. plur. after the substantivised mille, as v. 42 5 &c- 3 auri is
