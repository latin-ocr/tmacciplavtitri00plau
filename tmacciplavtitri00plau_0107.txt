sc. 1.] ΝΟ TES. 63

nimio pluris faciunt, ‘they value far more highly,’ v. 931 nimium miri-
modis mirabiles (locos), ‘wondrous in very wondrous wise,' v. 936 nimium
graphicum nugatorem, ‘a very exquisite braggart.' Here then nimium
strengthens the verb inuasit ‘has greatly i.e. violently attacked.’ Simi-
larly the verb is used of a disease Asin. 55 sed eum morbus inuasit
grauis.

29. plerique omnis, ‘almost all,' i.e. the meaning of omnis is nar-
rowed by the attribute plerique. So Ter. Andr. 55 quod plerique omnes
faciunt adulescentuli, Phorm. 172 ita plerique omnes sumus ingenio.
Omnis is a form for omnes constantly given by the best MSS. Varro,
L. L. V111. 66, says that in his time puppis and puppes, uestis and uestes
were rival forms, like Abl. oui and oue, aui and aue. Early inscrip-
tions generally give -esz but Lex Repetund. (123—122 B.c.) has ceiueis,
Sent. Minueiorum 117 B.C.‚ fineis and finis. Se? Lindsay, L. L.
p. 399, and cf. vv. 212, 307, 948, 1080, 1150, 1186.·

inim-mortui, ‘half-dead‚’ ‘hovering between (life and) death‚’ just as
‘twilight' is ‘the time ’twixt light (and darkness).’ The word is used
here only in Plautus.

30. flli=mores boni.

interim, ‘meanwhile‚’ an acc. sing. adv. form like partim, passim,
pedetemptim &c. These forms are very numerous in Old Latin. See
Lindsay, L. L. p. 556.

31. inrigua, passive ‘well-watered.’ So Hor. S. 11. 4. 16 inriguo
nihil est elutius horto.

33. uile, ‘cheap‚’ an allusion to the scarcity and high prices at
Rome, like v. 484 cena lzac annonast sine sacris hereditas. Vv. 32 and
33 were transposed by Buecheler (Rh. M. XXVII).

34. nimioque pluris, ‘value at a higher price by much‚’ ‘value sar
more highly (see on v. 28) the favour of the few! Pauciores )( plures:-
οἱ ὀλίγοι, ‘the aristocrats,’ ‘the optimates.’ Cf. the complaints of sels-
seeking v. 1033 ff.

35. faciunt, plur. after pars lzomz'num which implies a number of
persons, a common κατὰ σύνεσιν or adsensum construction.

quam id quod prosint pluribus, ‘than they (value) that wherein
they may benefit the many.’ This, the reading of A, is supported by
Shilleto (quoted by Prof. Mayor on Cic. 2 Phil. 21. 30, q.v.). Id is ace.
after faciunt, quod is the limiting (adverbial) acc. of neut. pron. so
common in Plautus, e.g. Curc. 327 sed quod te misi, nihilo sum certior,
‘but I am no wiser about what I sent you f0r‚’ lit. ‘as to what,' Cure.
456 quid lzoc quod ad te uenio? ‘ but what about the business on which I
