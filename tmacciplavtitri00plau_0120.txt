76 TRJNVMM VS. [ACT 1.

ego sum, Epid. 448 sed istum quem quaeris...ego sum, Most. 250 mulier
quae se suamque aetatem spernit, speculo ei usus est.

exturbasti ?=n0nne exturbasti? Ne is not repeated in the second
sentence, but its force is continued. If eum is retained we must scan
e‘xturbasti. Cf. vv. 250, 318, 385, 964.

138. edepol...probe. See v. 128 for this acc. of exclamation.
pulcre and probe ironical.

139. crede huic tutelam: suam melius rem gesserit, ‘ entrust
this man with the care of a boy, you’ll find he'll take more care of his
own interests‚’ i.e. consulet sibi, quum pupillo consulere deberet. The
imper. crede is bitterly ironical, the protasis of the sentence is in the
imper. See Roby, L.G. 1557. Cf. Ou. A. A. 11. 647 quod malesers,
adsuesce, feres bene, Cic. Verr. 11. 23 attendite .· iam intelligetis‚=si
attenditis &c.

141. adeo, i.e. ad·eo (cf. acl-quo, a variety of quo-ad, as Afranius
249 R. iratus essem adquo liceret) lit. ‘ there-to ’ means (1) ‘ moreover,'
‘ what is more,’ a regular comic use, as v. 181 neque adeo, atque adeo,
niue adeo, (2) ‘to such a point,' adeo res rediit, ‘things have reached
such a pass,' and of time adeo donec, (3) ‘to the end that,' adeo ut,
(4) with weakened force, merely to emphasise the word which it follows,
nunc adeo, nos adeo &c- See Langen, Beitr'age p. 139ff. Here we
may connect adeo ut as in (3). But as the regular construction is rubigo
ut, not subigo adeo ut, it is better to put a comma after adeo and take
nouo modo adeo together. ‘ You force me by your abuse, in a way too
quite strange to you, obliging me (ut mila· necesse sit) to entrust to you,
what has been secretly entrusted to my silence &c.’ The order is
subigis me, ut mihi necesse sit tibi concredere, quod concreditumst meae
taciturnitati, ne enuntiarem &c. Vt is repeated (v, 144) because of the
long interval which has intervened since it was first used in v. 141. cf.
Aul. 791 nunc te obtestor, Euclio, ut si quid ego erga te imprudens peccaui
aut gnatam tuam, ut mi ignoscas, Ter. Phorm. 153. For the position
and use of adeo cf. Amph. 981 haec curata sint fac sis, proinde adeo ut
uelle med intellegis, ‘ see please that these points are attended to, in 'the
way too that you see I wish.’ fide, see v. 117.

145. sumes ubi posiueris. Megaronides speaks of the secret to be
communicated to him as a sum of money, a deposit, entrusted to his

safe-keeping, which the owner will recover safely just where he placed
it. So Mil. 234 salua sumes indidem. Posiui is the sorm of the perf.
exclusively used by Plautus and Terence ε posui is used first by Ennius, .
then by Lucilius, Lucretius, Catullus. See Neue, Formenlehre 11. p.
