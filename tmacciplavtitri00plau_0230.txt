1114. But before this line something must be lost. Stasimus has
just said that Callicles has never swerved from his loyalty, although he
has incurred many a hardship on account of the property and children
of the absent Charmides. He might then conclude ‘But still in spite of
all he keeps saith! The line we have means more than this. Unus
cannot be thus accounted for. Leo gives the kind of line that must
have preceded this line, atque omnes homines esse dixi perfidos, then
v, 1114 is in place; ‘and yet I said that all men were faithless, but
Callicles, I fancy, if no one else, keeps faith.' Omnes perfidos gives the
required antithesis for lzic unus seruat fidem. ·

Exit Stasimus to the Harbour (left).

Some little time is supposed to intervene between this scene and the
next. The news of Charmides' return has become known, the promised
explanation has been given by Callicles (v. 1 137).

The interval is filled up by the tibicen. See on V. 601.

equivalent to a superlative and, as if it were a superlative, is followed
by the gen. ‘Yours truly is the foremost of all men.' Some editors
transpose the order of the words omnium hominum, but Brix shews
(Kritischer Anhang) that (except at the conclusion of one verse Men.
1053), omnes homines, omnes mortales' 1s the invariable order. Omnium
is dissyllabic by synizesis, as gaudium ν. 1116, gaudiis and gaudium

commoda, for commoda is part of the predicate, ‘so completely does all
I wish fall out as 1 would have it.’ ⁷

1118. quod ago adsequitur, subest, subsequitur. The line has
been impugned as a gloss on the previous line, and as wrongly sepa-
rating the two lines z'ta...z'ta. But it is too good for a gloss, and Leo’ s
