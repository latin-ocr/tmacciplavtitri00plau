comes to my hand and follows at my heels.' The assonance adsequitur,
subest, subsequitur is quite more Plautino, as Pers. 331 supersit, suppetat,
superstitet.

1119. suppeditat=suppetit, ‘is supplied to,' ‘is heaped upon.’ Cf.
v. 57 and Asin. 423 non queo labori suppeditare.

1121. peregre. See on v. 149. Ἰ
¹ 1122. ut. quae cum eius filio egi, ei rei fundus pater sit potior,
lit. ‘in order that, as to the things 1 have arranged with his son, sor that
matter the father may be a better guarantor,’ i.e. ‘that Ι may have the
fuller authorisation of the father for the arrangement Ι made with the
son-² quae, the neut. relative, followedby ei rei, as Mil. 765 id quod
agitur, lzuic rei primum praeuortz' decet, Pers. 393 si hoc adcurassis
lepide, quoi rei operam damus, Poen. 815 quando id, quoi rei operam
dedimus, impetrauz'mus. fundus=auctor‚ ‘guarantor,’ as populus legis
fundus, so Cic. pro Balb. 19, where see Dr Reid’s note.

eo <quantum potest> , the supplement is Leo's. quantum potest, ‘as
fast as possible‚' as v. 765. Niemeyer suggests eo <intro nunciam> .

SCENE 2 (1125-1189). The two old gentlemen come out of the
house in conversation. Callicles has given an account of his stewardship,
and Charmides has approved of all that he has done. Lysiteles listens
to what they say, then v, 1 150 presents himself to them. Lesbonicus is
pardoned, and all is arranged.

Metre: Septenarian Trochaics continued.

1125. in terra, in Plautus always3 in terris appears first in
Cicero. ,

1126. quoi fides fidelitasque amicum erga aequiperet tuam,
‘whose loyalty and lealness to a friend can rival yours.’‚ Quoi is not
dat„ but gen. (perhaps properly loc.), as it is in quoiquoimodi, cuicui-
modi, like illi modi, isti modi (Truc. 930). See Buecheler, Lat. Decl.
p. 39 3 Luchs, Genetivbildung, p. 29. Erga, anastrophe> of prep„ as
v. 822, and again v. 1128.

1127. exaemcauissetzex aedibus, eiecisset, sc. Lesbonicus (not in
its ordinary sense, as in v. 132). The· word is chosen here for the sake
of the word-play exaedificauisset...ex aedibus, ‘dishoused me frorn this
house.'

apsque te foret, ‘had it not been for you.’ See on v. 832. Δ

1128. bene reci. There is a double chiasmus in these lines:
(1) benefici ...consului fideliter, (2) uideor meruisse laudem, culpa caruisse
arbitror. Cf. vv. 431 and 701.
