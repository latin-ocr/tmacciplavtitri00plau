on the 15th of March. The aediles are here spoken of as still

“j ‘new,' they have recently entered upon their duties‚ so we must
ξ look for a festival which comes not long after the Ides of March.

This shews that the play was produced at the ludi Megalenses

or Megalensia which took place in April, for the ludi Romani
J were in Sept. and the ludi plebei in Nov.

The Megalensia became scenic in the year 194 Β. C. Hence
the play could not have been earlier than that year.

v. 542 tum autem Syrorum, genus quod patientzksz'mumst
hominum &c.

Syrian slaves may no doubt have been known in Rome

· before the war with Antiochus 191 B. C., but probably did not

appear in any great numbers until the close of the war.

v. 545 the allusion to the supplicium of the Campanians,
the mention of gold Philippics v. 152, the complaint of moral
corruption, self-seeking and greed vv. 28 ff., 283 ff„ 1028 ff. all
point to 190 ΗΟ. as the earliest year possible for the first
production of the play.

Thus we infer that the T rz'nummus belongs to the last
period of Plautus’ activity‚ and is one of his latest plays.

It will be remembered that there was at this time no per-
manent theatre at Rome. Wooden theatres with rows of seats
were built regularly each year after 145 B. C. ; the first stone thea-

7 tre was the Theatrum Magni completed by Pompey 54 B. C. In

the time of Plautus and Terence scenic displays took place near
the temple of the god in whose honour the festival was held.
A temporary wooden stage was put up, and the audience stood
unless they chose to have their own seats brought for them.

One play only was presented on each day. The performance
commenced about noon, and ended in time for the spectators to
return'home for dinner.

(3) The Text of the T rz'mtmmus.

Part of the Trinummus is contained in the great Ambrosian
Palimpsest A. The verses which it exhibits are 1——96‚ 17 3—569,
637-673, 738—-774‚ 836—863, and 1045—1078‚ i.e. a little more
than half the play.

On the whole the text of few plays is in a better condition.
