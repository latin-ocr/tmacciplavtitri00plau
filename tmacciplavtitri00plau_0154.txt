. 418. nequaquam argenti ratio conparet tamen, ‘all the same
the account of the money is by no means clear.’ Tamen refers to the³
last words of Stasimus, nisi tu inmortale rere esse argentum tibi, and'
means ‘even if I allow money can’t last for ever.' By conparet
Lesbonicus means ‘is not clear (to the mind),'' i. e. ‘does not seem to
agree‚’ ‘to balance.' But Stasimus takes it literally=‘is not clear (to
the eyes),' ‘is not visib1e‚’ and playing on the words conparet...apparet
replies ‘the account is clear enough' (‘here it is for you to see'), it is the'
money that est perdu.' For Greek words in Plautus see on v. 187· Cicero
has this passage in his mind Att. VI. 1. 1 non οἴχεται tua industria &c.‚'

conveyance ' (cf. testamento dare, usu capere ἃς.) than as a predicative'
dat. ‘as a possession.’ See Roby, L. G„ Pres. p. 1. a. In the famous
line Lucr. 111. 971 uitaque mancipio nulli datur, omnibus usu, “life is
given to no one by conveyance, to all by use ’(i. e. we none of us possess
the fee— simple of life, but only the‘ use, ’which might be broken before
any right grew up) both words are best explained as abl.
admodum, ‘precisely so. ’ See on v, 366. - -
422. Another ‘aside' by Philto. Opino is parenthetic, and does
not affect the syntax. This non· deponent form for opinor occurs Epid.
259, and other non· deponent forms in Plautus are assentw, arbitro, au·
cupo, auspice, crz'mzno, contemplo, cuncto, sabulo, frustro, induam, lucto,
minito, mereo, medzco, paci,sco uago, uenero. See Brix on Mil. 172 and:
Lindsay‚ L. L. p. 520. Early Latin allows the use of the' two forms side
by side3 but in the classical period there is less freedom, and one form
has ousted the· other. But Quintilian (lx. 3. 7) allows both assentio and
assentior. ’ ⁷ ’
