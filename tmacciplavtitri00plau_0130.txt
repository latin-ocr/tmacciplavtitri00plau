⁷ ACT 11. SCENE 1 (223—275). Lysiteles, the virtuous young man,
as his name derived from λυσιτελεῖν indicates, debates with himself in a
lyrical monologue (canticum) whether he shall pursue love and· pleasure
or property (223—234). He expounds the ways of love. When love
comes, ,property goes. The lover is a ruined man (2 3 5-2 55). He loses
credit and friends (2 56-265). Love then must be shunned. He resolves
to lead a steady lise (266—275).
, Such a canticum as this partly replaces the lost Chorus. The loss
of the Chorus is also to some extent made up by the moralising turn·
of certain characters in a play, such as Lysiteles and his father Philto
here. -

The resolve of Lysiteles to lead a steady life introduces naturally the
negotiations sor his marriage.

The whole of Act II. is devoted to the second element of the story,
viz, the marriage negotiations. Act I. is concerned with the position of
Callicles, Act ΙΙ. with the affairs of Lysiteles—these two strands will be
woven together in Act 111. , >

The metres in this canticum change with extraordinary rapidity.
Each change of subject and feeling is represented by a *corresponding
change of metre. The scansion of some lines is very doubtful, but the
metres are probably as follows 2-—See Niemeyer‚ Kritischer Anhang, Pae
