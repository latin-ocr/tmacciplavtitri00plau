178 TRIN VMM VS. [Ac‘r 1v.

1035. petere honorem pro flagitio more nt, ‘to sue for office as
the reward of shameful conduct is by custom a common thing.' Cf.
Epid. 30 (my master has lost his arms), ‘they deserted to the enemy.'
At iam ante alii fecerunt idem, erit illi illa res honori.

1036. strenuosos praeterire, ‘to pass over (in the choice for pro-
motion) men of energy.’ Strenuosos Loewe‚ strenuosus beside strenuos,
like iniurius, iniuriosus ,· obnoxius, obnoxz'osus. Leo conjectures stre—
nuz'ores from Epid. 446 nam strenuiori deterior εἰ praedicat διο.

nequam quidem, sc. morem, an acc. of exclamation like morem
inprobum in the previous line.

1037. magisque ιε sunt obnoxiosae quam parentes liberis, ‘and
the laws are more at the mercy of customs than—parents are at their
children's.' Is dat. plur.=m0ribus: parentes liberis παρὰ προσδοκίαν
for liberi parentibus, but in these topsy-turvy days ‘the parents are in
the children’s power,’ not uice uersa as it should be.

1039. eae miserae etiam ad parietem sunt fixae clame terreis,
‘the laws‚ poor thingS, are actually sastened to a wall with clamps o
iron.' The laws were graven on tablets of brass or wood and fastened
up in a conspicuous place. Stasimus alludes to this as if the laws were
unhappy persons wrongfully suffering punishment.

1040. nimio with aequius. Cf. vv. 28 and 387.

1041. Cf. Aul. 523 ff.

1043. neque istis quicquam lege sanctumst, ‘for such people
nothing is settled by a law.' Sanctum, ‘ settled that they are not to do
it‚’ ‘made penal‚' cf. sancire legem. The whole line is practically a
repetition of v. 1037. Ritschl condemns vv. ιο43-ιο45, and very
possibly the passage is interpolated‚ e.g. v. 1033. But it is arbitrary to
bracket lines in a passage like this on purely subjective grounds.

1044. qua sacrum qua publicum, ‘alike the property of the gods
and the property of the state.' Cf. v, 286 sacrum presumant, publicum
priuatum habent. qua...qua=et...et‚ Asin. 96 qua me, qua uxorem...
circumduce, Mil. 1 113 consectare qua maris qua feminas, ibid. 1392
eum oderunt qua uiri qua mulieres, Men. 666 qua uirum qua uxorem
di uos perdant. The use is colloquial until Livy's time. He has it often,
e.g. ΙΧ. 8. 3 reum qua infilicis belli qua ignominiosae pacis. Cicero
has it in the Letters only.

1046. malam rem magum, ‘a good thrashing.' Malum or mala
res is a euphemism sor the punishment of a slave by flogging, and is
naturally used here by a slave sor ‘a severe punishment.’ Hence malam.
rem mereri, quaerere, reperire &c., and the execration abi in malam rem.
