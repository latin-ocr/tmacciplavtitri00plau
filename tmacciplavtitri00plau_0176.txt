1 32 TRIN VMM VS. [Aer 111. Ξ

614. castigatorem, i.e. Megaronides. See v. 187. Exit Callicles
to ask Megaronides’ advice what he shall do under the new circum·
stances of the case. Stasimus is left alone and soliloquises until Lysi-
teles and Lesbonicus come up.

615. propemodum...sub01et mihi. ‘ I see pretty nearly why Calli-
cles there is in a hurry, and I have an inkling of the truth.’ ⁴ Pr0pemo-
dum is the only form used in the old Drama, propemodo and postmodo
are not early forms. See Lindsay, L. L. p. 5 59. Subolet milti, asv. 698
and Pseud. 421, only in Comedy and always impersonal.

616. ut agro euortat Lesbonicum, i.e. festinat ut agro euertat
Lesbonicum. Euortere is one of the many Plautine synonyms for
‘swindle.’ Others are circumducere, circumuortere‚ emungere, inter-
uortere, tangere, tondere. For the abl. cf. v. 601.

617. quom, ‘since,' causal, but followed by the indic„ as it is in
Plautus in all meanings. According to Draeger‚ in Plautus the indic.
follows quom in 229 passages, the subj. in 9. And these exceptions are
mostly due to assimilation, and apparent rather than real. The rule in
Plautus is to use the indic. after quom whether temporal, explanatory,
adversative, causal or concessive. See Miiller‚ Handbuch 11². p. 510 ff.
But in the classical period quom causal, adversative, or concessive is
used exclusively with the subj. Hence the correction quam (‘O my
master, how your property is being torn to shreds here in your absence '),
however neat, is unnecessary, although the latest and best editor of
Plautus, Leo, adopts it.

620. nimium difficilest, ‘it is very hard for a friend, in the true
sense of the word, to be found? On ita ut nomen cluet see ν. 309.

621. quoi quom credideris=talem ut quom ei credideris.

omni, ‘any,' as v. 338.

622. eccillum, ‘but there I see our (prospective) son-in-law coming
with his (intended) brother—in-law.' generum=Lysiteles who was to
marry the daughter of Stasimus' master, adfini (see on v. 331) is Lesbo·
nicus. On ecce see v. 386. Ecce with eum, eam, illum, illam, istum,
istam makes eccum, eccam, eccillum &c. (ι) If there is a main verb in
the sentence as here, the word is interjected without affecting the syntax.
(2) If there is no verb, eccum &c. are followed by the acc. (of exclama·
tion). Thus (1) Bacch. 61 r Mnesilochus eccum maestus progreditur
sbras, (2) Most. 560 sed Philolachetis seruom eccum Tranium. (3) In a
few cases these constructions are mixed, and eccum puts what should be
the subject into the acc.‚ as Mil. 1290 sed eccum Palaestrionem, stat cum
milite. Eccum is the original of the Italian ecco, and in Plautus at times
