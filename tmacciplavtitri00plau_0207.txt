attend, I would tell you.' Ita ut occepi is a standing formula for re-
sumption after a break or interruptim, and Charmides' aside is such an
interruption here.

901. ubi ipse erat 2⁷ ⁴ Cf. v. 928. qui uersum inseruit, lcoc eo consilio
secisse uidetur, ut deinde VV. 928—949 omitti possent. Cf. Teuffelius,
Mus. Rhen. 30. 632! Le0.

903. sesquipede quidamst quam tu longior, ‘he is a man a foot
and a half taller than you are? Sesqui‘, ‘ one and a half‚’ is *semis-que,
with the same syncope as in sestertius for semis-tertius, ‘ two and a half.’

904. haeret haec res, ‘here’s a puzzler.’ So Amph. 814 and Pseud.
985, of something that does not square with the facts, and therefore does
not admit of an explanation.

905. quicum. MSS. quocum, but quicum is Plautus' invariable
usage. Quicum is relative and interrogative, masc. and fem„ sing.
and plur. Thus v, 15 it is rel. fem. sing„ v. 953 as here, rel. masc. sing.
It is interrogative masc. Men. 3693 fem. Epid. 218 and ²41· It is
relative plur. Capt. 1003 aut anites aut coturnices dantur, quicum
lusitent. Other abl. forms in -z' are aliqui sor aliquo Epid. 332, qui-
quam Pers. 477. The old proverb, prouerbium uetustate contritum,
quoted of the honest man, Cic. de Off. 111. 19. 77, is dagnus est quicum

· in tenebris mices. Terence has both quicum and quocum. For further
particulars see the note in Brix’s Kritischer Anhang, p. 142.

906. quod edepol homin-i probo, ‘it is an honest man's name‚’ an
evasive answer given in the hope that the question will not be further
pressed.

907. 1111 edepol—flli—flli‚ ‘his name is—his name is—his name is.’
The Sycophant hesitates and stammers in doubt what to say. So Merc.
722, when the old gentleman is pressed by his wife to say to whom the
girl belongs, uin dicam quoiast? illa—illa edepol—uae mihi! nescio quid
dicam.

908. deuoraui nomen inprudens modo, ‘I‘ve just swallowed the
name unintentionally.’

909. intra. dentes conclusos, ‘imprisoned behind his teeth.' A
like comic exaggeration‚ Cure. 606, where the girl asks the parasite to
restore the ring which reveals her parentage, quid ego? sub gemmane
apstrusos habeo tuam matrem et patrem ,9

910. atque etiam modo uni-sabatur mnu in labris primoribus,
‘and yet just a minute ago it was on the tip of my tongue.’ Atque
as in v. 746, in labris primoribus like a meo primo nomine v. 885,
and Catull. 2. 3.
