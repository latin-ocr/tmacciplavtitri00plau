SC. 1v.] NOTES. 183

construction, which is a coordination of contrasted clauses, see v. 292.
The sense is ‘though I have survived all perils abroad, Ι am utterly
ruined here at home.' Therefore‚ if the two lines are to be cut down to
one, following Wagner's lead, I think it should be ego miserrumis periclis
per praedones plurumos. The repetition periclis. . ‚periclo does not in itself
count sor much against this line, see the instances quoted by Brix and
Nierneyer. It is perhaps in favour of W’agner's single line that it
heightens the intentional alliteration with p. Cf. Men. 2 52 potuit paucis
plura plane proloqui.

1090. hac aetate exercitus, ‘driven about the world at my time of
life.’ Exercitus seems to refer to his voyage rather than his worries,
though that is the meaning Epid. 529 aerumna exercitam med habet,
‘ keeps me harassed and worried. '

1091. adimit ammam, ‘my vexation (at finding all my labour lost)
takes away my breath '—animo male est or animo male fit is the regular
term for ‘1 feel faint.’ But he throws himself on Stasimus for support,
and. Stasimus offers to get him water. Even if there were a phrase
animum adimere, it would be impossible to change animam to animum
in view of animam in the next line.

uisne aquam tibi petam? ‘shall I get you water?' Amph. 1058
animo malest, aquam uelim, Mil. 1332 animo male factum est lzuic
repente miserae. Curre intro atque ecferto aquam. But water is a
reviver even where there is no faintness, as (metaphorically) Epid. 554
guttula pectus ardens mi aspersisti. Charmides is, as we say, ‘sick' at
the seeming frustration of his hopes, but not faint. uisne Merc. 486,
Most. 322, elsewhere always uin.

1092. res quom animam agebat, tum esse offusam oportuit, ι(ἰῑ is
too late for water now—) water should have been sprinkled (not on me,
but) on my property when it was gasping for breath‚ or ‘at its last gasp.' '
Help is too late now: I don't want help now, my property wanted it
then.

Charmides and Stasimus go and knock at the door of the house
purchased by Callicles from Lesbonicus.

The inuolutio is now complete. Callicles’ equivocal position, which
had already exposed him to misrepresentation, was rendered more
difficult by the marriage-proposal. How could he provide a dowry
without disclosing the existence of the treasure? The sending of the
Sycophant was intended to obviate this difficulty. But the unexpected
return of Charmides upsets the plan, and the appearance of the Sycophant
has seriously alarmed Charmides. His alarin is excited to the highest
