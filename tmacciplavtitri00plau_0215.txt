Sc. 11.] NOTES. 171

know,’ illum by attraction to the case of quem, as often happens when the
demonstrative is first, and its verb does not come till after the relative
sentence. See ou v. 137, and add Amph. 1009 Naucratem quem con-
uenire uolui, in naui non erat, Bacch. 420 sed tu qui pro tam corrupto
dicis causam filio, eademne erat baec disciplina tibi ἒ The speaker places
the name or pronoun emphatically first, and, as it were, without deter-
mining beforehand the structure of the whole sentence, attaches it to the
nearest verb, which is that of the relative sentence.
986. eho, quaeso an. See on ν. 55.

987. ain tu tandem ‘2 ‘do you really mean it?’ Ain (aisne), ain
tu, ain uero, ain tandem, ain tu tandem, always at the beginning of a

speech, either interrupting another speaker, or expressing surprise
and astonishment at what the other speaker has said. See Langen,
Beitr'age p. 1 19.

988. ipsissumus, ‘his veriest self‚’ ipse has failed to carry conviction,
a stronger word is wanted, and so the comic superlative ipfl‘ssumus is
coined‚ like αὐτότατος, Ar. Plut. 83. The form ipsima or ipsuma seems
to have been actually used colloquially in the Imperial period, as
Petronius, 69 p. 46. 16 Β, 75 p. 51. 23 Β. See on v. 397.

989. enim uero serio, ‘truly indeed, in sober earnest.’ The three
words are found in combination Poen. 435, and in Amph. 964 an id
ioco dixisti? equidem serio ac uero ratus, serio is the antithesis of ioco.
This is its force here. ‘Now that Ι am convinced you are Char-
mides in all sober seriousness, seeing that you are back horne again '——
then after professing to speak serio he continues ioco with a παρὰ
προσδοκίαν ending.

990. uapulabis meo arbitratu et nouorum aedilium, ‘you shall be
flogged at the discretion of myself and the new aediles.' After quoniam
aduenis we expect a promise of the cena aduenticia or uiatz'ca with which
a safe arrival was always celebrated, as Bacch. 94 and 537, Epid. 7,
Stich. 471, Truc. 127, and Cure. 562, where the promise of a dinner
takes an unexpected turn. But παρὰ προσδοκίαν, the promise of a dinner
is replaced by the promise of a flogging. The Sycophant treats Char-
mides as a slave who has acted badly, and is to be flogged sor it. See
v. 708. He coolly associates himself with the aediles in determining
the amount of the punishment. The line is important as shewing that
the play was probably acted at the Megalensia, and could not have been
earlier than the year 194 B.c. See Introduction, p. xxxv.

992. dl te perdant, st te flocci facto an periisses prius. A second
time the Sycophant begins as if he were going to offer congratulations
