507. haec res grauiter 00011111, ‘my property here has been
seriously diminished.’ Lesbonicus points, as he speaks, to the house
now sold to Callicles.

509. diuitiis (scanned ditiis) is Bergk’s correction of de stultitiis
meis A, de stultitia mea BCD, a reading which came from stultitia two
lines above.

510. supernt=superest, ‘alone is lest remaining! Superfieri is a
Plautine word, the opposite of defieri, as Epid. 346, Mil. 356, Pseud.
456. Relicuos is always quadrisyllabic in Plautus, and so is the noun
reliquiae. It became trisyllabic by the middle of the first cent. A.D.

511. profecto dotem nil moror, ‘I assure you I don’t care about a
dowry.' See on v. 297. For certumst and certa res (est), ‘I am deter-
mined,' see v. ²70·

513. caue sis feceris, ⁴ pray don't do it! Cdu? by the ‘breuis
breuians' becomes edue‘, sis: si uis, for caue jeceris see Roby, L. G. 1608 ff.
‘caue with the simple subj. is very common with the znd pers„ es·
pecially in poetry,’ e.g. Epid. 400, 437, 439.

514. etlam tu taces? ‘will you hold your tongue? ” Etiam is used

Philto, te uolo, ‘I want you, Philto.’ The word needed to complete
the elliptic sentence te uolo is conloqui. So vv. 717, 963, 1059. The
phrase is given in full Pseud. 245 em conloqui qui volunt te, ‘see here
are the people who want to talk to you,' followed Pseud. 251 by te
uolo.

517. siquid uls, ‘at your service‚' i.e. siquid uis, operam do tibi.
The same elliptic colloquialism occurs Asin. 639, but Capt. 978 more
fully si quid me uis, impera, Amph. 391 dic si quid uis.

huc concede aliquantum, ‘just step a little this way.' For the acc.
aliquantum cf. Asin. 9² 5 abscede ergo paululum istuc, Epid. 238 abscessi
