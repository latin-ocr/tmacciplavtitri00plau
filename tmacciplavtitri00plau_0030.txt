(eg. Amphitruo, Casina, Menaechmi, Pseudolus) are post—
Plautine. In any case the Prologue is no part of the play
proper. It merely does what the modern programme or play-
bill now serves to do. It was not spoken by one of the
characters, but by an actor dressed for the purpose (ornatu
prologi).

The constituent parts proper, then, of the play are the
dialogue (diuerbium, or deuerbium as some write it) and the
cantica. A canticum proper was a lyrical monologue (μονῳδία)
accompanied by the flute, and delivered with appropriate
gesture. A change of metre represented a change of feeling.
Hence the metres are very varied and the rhythms very lively.
In a wider sense under the cantica are included the scenes
written in trochaic Septenarii declaimed with musical accom-
paniment—what we should call recitative. All iambic scenes
are included as diuerbia. They had no musical accompaniment,
and include all the quiet parts of the play, the ordinary narrative
and dialogue, as distinguished from the excited and high-
wrought scenes.

This distinction is sometimes marked in MSS. by the letters
C and DV¹‚ which indicate the musical and non-musical portions‚
as Canticum and Diuerbium.

The Tibicen served two purposes: (1) he filled up the short
intervals during which the stage was vacant, (2) he furnished an
accompaniment to all cantica, including both the cantica proper
and the trochaic scenes.

(b) The Greek rule which required—with some exceptions—
that there should not be more than three actors on the stage at
once, or employed in a play, was not observed in Roman Comedy.
Often five actors are necessary. In only two of the extant plays
of Plautus, Cistellaria and Stichus, ’ both of which are in-
complete, would three actors be sufficient. The Captiui, Epidicus,
Mercator, Pseudolus require at least four ; ten of the plays demand

¹ These marks given in the Palatine text are not older than the
Arguments. DV for dz‘uerbz‘um is like P.F. :praefecum d.d.=dedicare‚
q.d.=quondam‚ which are scarcely to be found in inscriptions before
the ‘znd century.
