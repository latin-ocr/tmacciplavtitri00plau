way’=frustra‚ ‘ in vain‚' is spelt in B nequidquam (the old abl. form ?)‚

441. hio postulet nug-i esse, nugas postulet, ‘if Lesbonicus here
expected to be steady, he would expect impossibilities.' Hic postulet
=si hic postulet. The pres. subj. of an entirely hypothetical case
without any opinion that the hypothesis is really practicable‚ as vv, 148,
457, 474, 628. Langen, Beitr‘age, p. 43 ff„ discusses the Plautine usage.
The Latin language at the time of Plautus had not yet reached the
stage at which possible and realisable wishes and conditions were
expressed by pres. or perf. subj.‚ impossible and unfulfilled by imperf.
and plup. It had reached the stage at which realised conditions were
expressed by the indic„ unrealised by the subj.‚ whether the realisation
was considered possible or impossible. On nugas see v. 396.

445. hau nosco tuom, ‘ Ι don't recognise you,' lit. ‘ your way ’ or
‘characten’ Your coming to make a mock of me is so unlike you that
you are changed beyond recognition. So meum, ‘my way,' vv, 12 3 and
631, Ter. Eun. 1066 non cognosco nostrum tam superbum, where Bentley
explains non solebatis esse tam superbi.

446. bonis turs rebus, rather abl. instr. ‘ by means of your
prosperity,’ than mere abl. absolute ‘ when you are prosperous.'

44⁷. ita me amabit Iuppiter, ‘so shall heaven be kind to me, as
I neither come to mock you nor think that a right thing to do.’ Ita me
amabit Iuppiter is a positive assertion ‘so shall,' ita me di ament v. 1024
is properly a wish ‘so may,’ but both are used as strong asseverations,
that as surely as the speaker hopes for happiness what he says is true.
The asseveration may be followed (ι) by ut answering ita, as Aul. 496
ita me di amabunt ut ego hunc ausculto lubens, (2) immediately by the
main proposition as here, (3) as in v. 1024 by an accus. of exclamation.
dignum puto, like aequom censeo vv. 306 and 392. Cf. Aul. 223 neque
edepol ego te derisum uenio neque derz'de0‚ neque dignum arbitror.

449. uerum hoc quod dixi, ‘but as Ι said'=ita ut dixi.

451. mearum rerum ordinem, ‘the rank befitting my fortune‚' ‘the
social position to which my means entitle me.'

452. factio in a political sense is ‘a party,’ ‘a following‚' homo
fizctz'osus, ‘a man with a following,’ ‘an influentia] man.' In a social
sense factio is ‘the circle in which one moves‚' ‘social standing.' So
Aul. 227 factiosum, ‘a man of social influence.' Cist. 493 neque nos

factione tanta quanta tu sumus. But factio has another meaning Bacch.
843 quae lzaec factiost?=faciendi ratio, and it is perhaps from this use
