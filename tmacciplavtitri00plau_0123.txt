se. 11.] NOTES. 79

hea‘vens‚' not a real invocation. These phrases are generally elliptic‚ as
v. 591 di, uostramfidem (sc. imploro), pro deum inmortalium (sc.fidem),
di melius, dz' meliora &c. Pro is followed either by voc. as here, or by
aec. of exclamation as pro deorum atque hominum fidem, Cic. Tusc. v.
16. The order of the following words is quam cito paucis uerbis (instr.)
alium me fecisti. For alium...alius cf. Verg. Georg. 1. 4²0 pectora
motus 1 nunc alios, alios dum nubila uentus agebat, Ι concipiunt.

162. sed ut occepisti and v. 897 ita ut occepi, a standing formula
for resuming a narrative after an interruptim, ‘ but as you began‚’ more
fully Rud. 1 1 19 ut id occepi dicere.

perge porro proloqui, ‘ go on further to explain! Proloqui, an infin.
after perge, like Men. 244, 245 operam numquam sumam quaerere...
numquam desistam exsequi, and see note on v. 76. Porro, an adv. mean-
ing motion towards, like retro, citro, ultro. From the spelling porod on
a Praenestine cista it is clear that ῦ represents -ὅιί, the old abl. ending of
O-stems. Porro means (1) ‘ farther ² (of space), (α) ‘ further‚' (3) ‘more-
over.’ Perge porro is like loquere porro, ausculta porro &c- ’ Perge does
not require porro, but the emphatic pleonasm is in the style of comedy,
as redemi russum v. 182.

163. qu1=quo modo, ‘how Charmides' forethought, my loyalty and
the whole secret were almost utterly ruined by that blockhead.' The
proper sequence after qui would be dederit, but owing to the length of
⁴ the relative sentence and the position of the verb at the end, the subj. is
ἀνακολούθως replaced by the indic. dedit. Cf. Amph. 17 nunc cuius
iussu uenio et quam ob rem uenerim dicam, Rud. 355 non audiuisti quo
pacto leno clanculum nos hinc auferre uoluit...inposiuit ? The distinc-
tion between dependent and independent questions διο. had not been
sully made in Plautus' time. This is clear from the cases where indic.
and subj. are used together without difference of meaning, as Cist. 58
eloquere...'et quid tibi est et quid uelis nostram operam.

165. ignauum-mm. sing. Old Latin avoided —uu, hence suo‘s, not
suus, suom not suum, quom not quum δια, but at the end of the third
cent. B.c. ὅ passed into u‘, e.g. bonum for earlier bonom, but equom till
the time of Quintilian. Ille ignauos: Lesbonicus.

pessum deun, lit. ‘sent to the bottom.’ So pessum ire, pessum
abire, pessum premere, like uenum dare (uendere), uenum ire (uinire),
nuptum dare, nuptum ire ἃς.

166. quidum ⁸1: πῶς δή; see vv. 14 and 98.

run dum sum ego unos sex (Hes, ‘while Ι am in the country for
only a few days.' Ruri is the true loc. form, and rure is properly
