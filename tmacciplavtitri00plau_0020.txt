the 11th cent, formerly in the Palatine Library at Heidelberg,
since 1622 in the Vatican Library at Rome. It contains all
20 plays, and is referred to after Ritschl as B.

(2) Codex alter of Camerarius, usually described as Decur-
tatus and marked C (11th cent.). It contains the last 12 plays,
was at Heidelberg and Rome with B, but was taken to Paris
1797, and at the French Restoration to Heidelberg.

(3) Ursinianus or Vaticanus—11th or 12th cent—contains
like C, which it closely resembles, the last 12 plays with Amphi-
truo, Asinaria, Aulularia, and half the Captiui. This MS. was
brought from Germany to Rome in the possession of Cardinal
Orsini, 1429, and from it first the last 12 plays became known—-
*the first 8 had been known and copied uninterruptedly. 1t is

referred to as D.
(4) Codex J, in the British Museum, assigned by Ritschl to

the 11th cent., containing the first eight plays. Its value is
disputed. Goetz pronounces it to be important, though very
carelessly written. With this may be classed E, a MS. of
the 13th cent. belonging to Ritschl, containing like J only the
first eight plays.

These MSS. proceed from one special recension of the text,
and are known as the Palatine text.

MSS. of the third class resemble E and J in the first eight,
D in the last 12 plays. They are late in date—Isth cent.-and
unimportant for the criticism of the text. F is used to represent
Codex Lipsiensis—15th cent. -belonging to the University of
Leipzig; V the 12th cent. Leyden MS.; Z the editio princeps
by G. Merula, Venice 1472.

5. Prosody. Our notions on the scansion of Latin are
derived from Horace, Vergil and Ovid. But their standard,
framed upon Greek models, was impossible for a writer living
at the time of Plautus, Plautus followed like all early scenic
poets the custom of popular speech in the measuring and
reckoning of syllables, and generally in questions of scansion
and prosody. The new tendency commences—in Plautus' life-
time—with the introduction by Ennius of the Greek Hexameter.
Hence there arose for the hexameter a system of rules and
