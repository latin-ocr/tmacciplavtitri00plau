‘a degree of correctness which sharply separated syllables and
assigned them their unvarying metrical length and value. But
with the Iambic and the Trochee of dramatic poetry the case
was different, not only with Plautus, but with Ennius himself,
Terence, Accius and Pacuvius. Catullus and Horace first ap-
plied to the Iambic metre the Greek rule strictly observed in
the Hexameter.

The Plautine measurement of syllables thus naturally corre-
sponds to the looseness of popular usage. The sharp rules
for lengthening by position and fixed length had not yet been
introduced. But it is by no means always possible to explain
in all cases the popular usage followed. Thus ferentarius, seden-
tarius are scanned with the second syllable short. Probably this
is because the n was scarcely sounded, but it may have been

that a syllable was slurred.
Cicer0‚ Orat. 161, discusses the weak sound of final s, and

quotes instances from Lucilius, &c.‚ to shew how it was neglected.
Only poetae noui found it a stumbling-block. He himself pro-
nounced maximus maximu' in his youth. Thus in Plautus, even
in the 6th foot of the Senarius, which is always a pure iambus,
and at the close of an iambic Tetrameter acatalectic (=not a
syllable short, i.e. with 8 feet), and trochaic Tetrameter catalectic
(=a syllable short, i.e. with 7} feet), s is not counted. Hence
such terminations as commoniths sum, saluos sis, estis nunc,

occidistis me, &c.1
Similarly a mute before a liquid does not affect the length

of the syllable, so that agros, libros, duplex, &c. are not spondees

but iambi.
We may note the following general principles of Plautine

prosody.
A. Shortening of long syllables.
The most noteworthy cases are those in which words which

we should naturally scan as iambi (v -) become pyrrhic (ν ν).
When the accent or emphasis of pronunciation fall's upon the
short first syllable, the second syllable instead of being long is
