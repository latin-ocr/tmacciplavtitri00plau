xxii ΙΝ TR OD U C TI ON.

Less common instances ‘of the original shorter form are

postus (positus), poplus (populus), manuplares (manipulares).
Verbs which shew an omission of the root vowel are surgo,
pergo (porgo) and surpio for surripio.
With adjectives ending in —er Plautus more usually writes the
longer form—dextera is more usual than dextra. But he often

has dextrouorsum, and apparently altra, altrum, for altera,
alterum.

The short form is very common in 2nd pe'r. sing. of so-called
perf„ and in so-called perf. inf„ e.g. dixti, duxti, uinxti‚ pinxti,
uexti‚ misti, scripsti, accepsti, dixe, duxe, uexe, spexe, traxe,
intellexe, &c. Dixisti, duxisti, &c. are of later origin.

b. meus, tuos, suos (not tuus, suus), deus are scanned as
monosyllables. So quoius, quoi, huius, huic, rei, dies, diu, fui,
trium, duas, ais, ain, ait, eo, eam, eas, eat, eant, διε.

The trisyllabic forms of meus, tuos, suos, deus, &c. are
dissyllabic. So duorum, duellum, fuisti, fuisse, puella, diebus,
&c. Diutius and exeundum are trisyllabic. ’

The vowels are regularly run together in proin, proinde,
dein, deinde, dehinc, deerrare, dehortari, deosculari, and deesse.

To the same principle we may assign a number of shortened
case-forms, is for iis, isdem for iisdem, and verb-forms exit, redit
(perf.>‚ aibam, aibas, and so on.

6. Hiatus. The general attitude of Latin to hiatus is given
by Cicero Orat. 150, ‘Quod quidem Latina lingua sic observat,
nemo uttam rusticus sit, qui uocales nolit coniungere.³ Greek
allowed hiatus, but ‘nobis‚ ne si cupiamus quidem, distrahere¹
uoces conceditur.' Then, after quoting examples of hiatus from
Naeuius and Ennius, he concludes ‘hoc idem nostri saepius non
tulissent) Quintilian also (ΙΧ. 4. 33) disapproves ‘uocalium
concursum, quod cum accidit, hiat· et intersistit2 et quasi laborat
oratio.²

In Plautus, as his text has reached us, hiatus occurs between
two words closely connected—a preposition and its noun, a pair

¹ distrahere=to leave an hiatus )( contrahere.
² intersistit :comes to a standstill.
