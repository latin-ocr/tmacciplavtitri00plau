62 TRIN VMM VS. [Ac‘r 1.

24. inmoenest facinus, ‘a thankless office.' Festus p. 109 inmu-
nis, uacans munere: aliquotiens pro improbo ponitur. But cf. Merc.
105 dico eius pro meritis gratum me et munem sore, ‘obliging.' F or.

the spelling inmoene for inmune (as in vv. 350 and 354) cf. moenera and .

munera, Poenus and Punicus, poena and punire, and oenus for unus:
oe replaces older oi and later u, as coirauit, coerauit, curauit. See
Lindsay, Latin Language, pp. 246—248.

in aetate, ‘in life,’ ‘in this world.' Cf. v. 462 and Rud. 1235 in
aetate hominum. In this sense sometimes with a possessive gen„ but
always without the possessive pronouns, i.e. in aetate or in aetate homi-
num, not in aetate mea &c. Men. 838 qui saepe aetate in sua &c. is
a different use.

25. conducibile, ‘advantageous.’ Plautus is fond of adjs. in -bilis.
This word sor instance occurs some six times in Plautus, but is hardly
found elsewhere.

nam, ‘the reason why I say this is that.' nam introduces a par-
ticular illustration of the general statement that has just been made. It
gives not the reason why it is thankless to find fault with a friend, but
explains Megaronides' purpose in speaking.

26. concastigabo...commer1ta‚ the compounds are stronger than
the simple castigare and meritam v. 23.

27. inuituS...1nu1tet playing on the similarity of sound, as Rud.
811 inuitas, ni istunc istis inuitassitis. Perhaps we may translate
‘against my will, did not loyalty will that 1 should do so.' Alliteration
and assonance are very common in Plautus. Note faciam fides in this
line and morbus mores in the next, followed by mores mali in ν. 3ο
and metere messem maxumam in v. 32. ni inuitet, ‘did not loyalty
call me to do so’ (but loyalty does call me to do so). The pres. subj.
expresses a state of things that really exists‚ a non-existent state of
things would be expressed by the imperf. So Sall. Iug. 31. 1 multa me
dehortantur a uobis, Quirites, ni studium rei publicae omnia superet,
‘did not zeal for the commonwealth outweigh all considerations (but
it does outweigh all).’ Tibull. 1. 4. 63 carmina ni sint, ex umero
Pelopis non nituisset ebur, ibid. Ι. 8. 21, 22 cantus et e curru Lunam
deducere temptat, et faceret, si non aera repulsa sonent, Catull. vl. 2 with
Prof. R. Ellis' note.

28. hic, ‘here,’ referring to Athens in the original, but meant to be
understood in Plautus of Rome. So VV. 33, 34.

nimium and nimio in Plautus regularly=‘very‚’ ‘very much)
strengthening the force of adj„ verb or adv„ not ‘too much.’ So v. 34
