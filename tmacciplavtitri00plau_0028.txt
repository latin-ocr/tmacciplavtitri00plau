Short notes on the chief metres only are here given.

The Iambz'c Senarz'us is the regular metre of dialogue, where
there is no excitement, but calm straightforward narrative.
Greek Iambics have accustomed us to the idea that the 2nd‚
4th and 6th feet, which mark the metre, must be pure [v -].
But the Latin poets admitted spondees [- —]‚ and even ana-
paests [vv-], not only in the Ist‚ 3rd and 5th, but also in the
2nd and 4th feet. The 6th foot only must necessarily be a pure
iambus. The verse seldom ends with two iambi. Diomedes
asserts that tragic poets always wrote a spondee in the 5th foot.

There is no objection to dactyls [-vv] provided there are
not too many, and a dactyl is seldom followed by an anapaest.

Most licence is allowed in the first foot, where a proceleus-
matic [ν ν ν ν], a bacchic [- — v], or a cretic [- ν -] is sometimes
found.

Penthemimeral is more common than hephthemimeral cae-
sura. Hiatus is most common at the caesura,

The Trochaz'c Septenarz’us (tetrameter trochaicus catalecti-
cus) was employed when the speech was important or excited,
and is used by Plautus with great effect. There is a diaeresis
after the 4th foot which should coincide with the end of a word.
This is occasionally neglected. A tribrach [vv-⁴] can be sub-⁴
stituted for a trochee [— v]‚ except in the 7th foot where it is
rare—a spondee can be used not only in 2nd‚ 4th and 6th (as in
Greek), but in Ist‚ 3rd and 5th.

The Latin admitted a dactyl instead of a spondee, save in
the 4th foot‚ where it is rare. A dactyl is most common in the
first foot.

The Iambz‘c Septenarz'us (tetrameter iambicus catalecticus)
is a favourite comic metre. The treatment is the same as that
of the Senarius, except that, as there is a diaeresis after the 4th
foot‚ that foot and the 7th ought to be pure. But tribrachs,
spondees and dactyls are found in the 7th foot.

Octonariz'‚ iambic and trochaic (i.e. tetrametri acatalectici)‚ are
used by Latin Comedians in highly excited scenes where great
