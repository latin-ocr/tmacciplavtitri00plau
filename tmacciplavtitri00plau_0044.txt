xl INTROD UCTJON.

Comedy Greek ideas about slavery had changed. Euripides

may be taken as the mouthpiece of liberal Athens on the
subject (see Ion 854, Hel. 728). ‘The slave-world was utterly

different ; the Roman slave was a piece of household-surniture‚
the Attic slave was a servant. Where marriages of slaves occur
or a master carries on a kindly conversation with his slave, the
Roman translators ask their audience not to take offence at
such things which are usual in Athens; and when at a later
period comedies began to be written in Roman costume, the
part of the crafty servant had to be rejected, because the Roman
public did not tolerate slaves of this sort overlooking and
controlling their masters' (Mommsen, 11. 432).

There is no more striking proof that a foreign life is being
presented in Roman Comedy than the fact that whenever it is
necessary to refer to a Roman law, a Roman custom, a Roman
poet, the Roman language, the thing is described in true Greek
style as ‘barbarian.'

This very representation of a life foreign to the audience
imposed many restrictions on the adapter. He must perforce
cut out all characters that would be incomprehensible to an
ordinary Roman. He must trim the conversation, the dishes,
the jokes down to the level of his hearers. These remarks may
serve to explain at once why the treatment of the originals is so
free and why the life described is so essentially un—Roman.

In one point of the treatment ,of slaves on the stage
Mommsen sees the hand of the adapter who is adding some-
thing outside his original. ‘In the endless abundance of
cudgelling and in the lash ever suspended over the back of
the slaves we recognise very clearly the household government
inculcated by Cato, just as we recognise the Catonian opposition
to women in the never-ending abuse of wives' (11. 435). The
criticism is true, if understood of the extent to which these things
are dwelt on—not of their presence in the plays together.

The whole of Mommsen's two chapters on ‘ Faith and
Manners' and ‘Literature and Art’ (11. 394—479) deserve close
attention from the student of Roman Comedy.
