1 54 TRINVMM VS. [ACT 1v.

gratiasque habeo et fluctibus salsis, ‘and I feel gratitude also to
the salt waves.' Et unites the waves with Neptune, salsis corresponds
with salszpotenti, ‘to the salt waves as well as to the lord of the
salt sea.' gratiZs is a dissyllable by synizesis. So glon‘ssm v. 828, οίῖῧ
ν. 838, fillo v. 839. Gratias habeo, not the usual gratiam (see v. 659)
in such thanksgivings, and the plur. here is perhaps partly due to the
plur. laudes, grates. Cf. Asin. 545 Perfidiae laudes gratiasque habemus
merito magnas.

822. quos penes mei fuit summa. potestas, ‘who had in their
hands complete power over me.' Quos refers to Mptuno as well as
fluctibus. Quos penes, anastrophe of preposition as v. 1146, which is
most usual with dissyllabic prepositions erga, inter, penes and especially
propter. ’

quid roret, ‘what was to become of.' For the two possible con·
structions, dat. and abl„ see v. 157. The whole clause is epexegetic of
mei summa potestas.

823. quom in an expression of thanks has both temporal and
causal force, it explains both the time and the reason for the
thankfulness. Cf. Most. 431 habeo, Neptune, gratiam magnam tibi,
quom med amiszstz' abs te, Rud. 906 Neptuno has ago gratias meo pa-
tr0n0,...qu0m me ex suis locis pulchre ornatum expediuit, which also
illustrates suis ex locis here.

After patriam the MSS. give urbis cumam (B cummam): urbem sic
columem is conjectural, ‘because they now bring me back thus safe to
the city of my fathers) For columem see v. 743. Other conjectures are
in patm‘am urbem incolumem and Leo’s in patriam suauissumam.

824. atque, ‘and indeed‚' antezpraeter, ‘beyond‚’ here and Asin.
858 scito illum ante omnes minumz‘ mortalem preti.

825. auidis moribus, because the sea swallows all it can.

826. spurcfflcum‚ ‘filthy in thy ways‚' ἅπαξ εἰρημένον on the analogy
of spurcidz'cus.

ego contra opera expertus, sc. sum (see on v. 535), *Ι have found
you by experience just the opposite.' So Bacch. 387 id opera expertus
sum esse ita. Contrd (properly contra abl. sem. of an A-stem) is an
adm, not a prep.‚ in Plautus and Terence.

827. placido te et clementi meo usque modo, ut uolui, usus sum
ln alto, ‘I on the deep found you ever mild and merciful, just as Ι would
have you be.' Others for meo read eo modo ut uolui=e0 modo quo uolui,
like Capt. 778 eodem pacto ut comici serui solent. Utor followed by the
abl. See on v. 1.
