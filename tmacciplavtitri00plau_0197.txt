819. actum reddam nugacissume, ‘I'll do the job and fool him
utterly-⁹ Nugacissume=cum maximis nugir. Actum reddam like red-
dere transactum‚ perfectum, ecfictum, inuentum, inpetratum &c.‚ and the
same construction with dare and facere. Exeunt, Callicles to his house,
Megaronides to the Forum.

AC'r IV. (820—-1 1 14). Callicles' position has been made much more
difficult by the proposal for his ward’s hand, and the question how to
provide a dowry for her without revealing the existence of the treasure—
first complication. To obviate this difficulty a Sycophant is hired to
say that he comes from Charmides with letters and money. But
Charmides returns unexpectedly at this moment, and encounters the

Sycophant, who does not know him, outside his own house, when
a ludicrous scene takes place. Thus the mission of the Sycophant

’ 'makes things worse—second complication. Even Charmides is now

uncasy about the action of Callicles, and'his suspicions are pointed by
a chance meeting with Stasimus. Only at the end of the Act does he
see Callicles and the disentanglement (euolutz’o) begin.

SCENE 1 (820—842). Charmides returns from abroad by the entrance
from the harbour (left). He is dressed in travelling costume (χλαμύς
and πέτασος) and returns thanks to Neptune for his safety. These
thanksgivings on safe return are a burlesque of the tragic use. Compare
with this the thanksgivings Capt. 922, Mil. 411, Most. 431, Pers. 753,

Rud. 906, Stich. 40²·
Metre: Anapaestic Tetrameters-the last four half-lines Anapaestic

Dimeters.

820. salsipotenti et mmtipotenti, ‘to Neptune mighty lord of the
salt sea.’ Buecheler followed by Leo changes multz'potenli to mulsi-
potenti (cf. Rud. 588, Pseud. 739). This is tempting, but as Plautus
uses the word multz’pOtens elsewhere, e.g. Bacch. 652, the change is at
least not necessary. Cf. uiripotens Pers. 252, caelipotens Pers. 755.

aetherei. Scaliger’s correction of et Nerei. Iuppiter aetherius:
Homer’s Ζεὺς αἰθέρι ναίων.

821. laetus lubens laudes ago et grates, ‘joyous and joyful I
render praises and thanks.' The pleonastic redundance is meant to
express the heartiness of Charmides' thankfulness‚ for which no words
are sufficient. Laetus lubens, asyndeton as vv. 243, 302, and there is also
triple alliteration with l and double with g. Grates, commonly of thanks
to the gods, gratias to men. Cf. Mil. 41 1 Ephesiae Dianae laeta laudes
gratesque agam.
