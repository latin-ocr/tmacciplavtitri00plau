myself?’ The line as it stands is too long, and to bracket the first milzi
seems the simplest remedy‚ as the second mihi is common to both mem-
bers of the sentence. The whole may perhaps better be understood
sarcastically, without a note of interrogation, ‘of course you understand
my business better than I do myselfi’

637. auid est sapere, ut qui beneficium a. beneuolente repudies?
‘do you call it ‘sense,’ to spurn a kindness from a friend?' Beneficium
a beneuolente repzcdzkzre=beneficium a beneuolente accipere nolle. Qui is
the old abl. of the indes„ enclitically attached to ut as it is to hercle
v. 464, q.v.

638. quod quoi facias non placet=qu0d non placet ei quoi facias.

639. officio migrat, ‘desert its duty.' On the abl. see v. 265. „

640. quin rumori seruiam, ‘from caring what people say‚’ i.e.
'from acting in such a way as not to get myself talked about.

641. quid ais? ‘look here.’ Quid ais? is used in its idiomatic
sense—see on v. 193—as a question to call a person's attention to
another question which follows. Only the real question itan διε. is for
the moment postponed by the parenthetical sentence nam... promeres
which explains Lysiteles' position.

promeres, ‘deserve.’ Nonius, p. 47 5 ‘promeres pro promereris,’quoting
this passage. The word is used in malam partem as here, Amph. 570
quid mali sum promeritus ?, but in bonam partem Asin. 128 and else·
where. Lysiteles is now thoroughly angry. Heretofore Lesbonicus
has been only too indifferent what people did say: now all of a sudden
he is so scrupulous to avoid offence, that he will reject a kindness from a
close friend, lest ‘people should talk.’

642. itan tandem...perderes ἱ), ‘do you really mean to maintain
that your ancestors bequeathed to you the reputation you enjoy (your
good name), simply that you might scandalously squander what had
s been earned by their thrift? ’ Itane, itane uero, &a in a surprised and
indignant question—ut as often, ‘to indicate the sorry end of so much,’
e.g. Lucr. 1. 100 exitus ut classi felix faustusque daretur, ‘ all forsooth to
enable the fleet to sail.' Did Lesbonicus’ forefathers ‘toil and spin'
that he might squander ‘an unearned increment ⁹? The passage, though
it may probably enough have come from Philemon, is entirely Roman
in feeling. A distinguished father paved his son’s path to office, the son
must keep the road open sor his descendants.

644. atque honori posterorum tuorum ut uindex fieres, ‘and to
enable you to assert your children's claim to office, your father and your
grandfather have made the road to attain office easy and smooth sor
