94 TRINVMMVS. [ACT 11.

276—278 Anapaest. Dim.
279, 81, 83 Cretic Tetram.

280 Anapaest. Dim.
282, 4, 5, 6 Octonarian Iamb.
287—292 Anapaest. Dim.
293, 5, 7 Cretic Tetram.
294, 6, 8-—300 Anapaest. Dim.
301—391 Septenarian Troch.

According to this scheme vv. 288—292 are made into two lines each,
and so v. 299—300 is divided.

276. quo mic homo foras se penetrauit. ⁴2 ‘ whither has that fellow
(my son, Lysiteles) betaken himself ?’ Penetrare is used as a transi·
tive (reflexive) verb. So vv. ‘²91 and 314, Amph. 250 penetrant se in
sugam, but Bacch. 66, according to the ,Mss.‚ it is intransitive, penetrem
huius modi in palaestram ? See on v. 146. Spengel penetrauit? But
MSS. penetrauit ex aedibus ,⁹ Ex aedibus may be a gloss on saras.

278 a. neque tibi ero 1n mora, ‘ I will not delay you.’ So Ter.
Andr. 467 ne in mora illi sis, Pers. 51 caue suas mi in quaestione=‘ be

to seek,’ Cic. Fam. V111. 14 quod iudicium nunc in expectatione est, etiam
in bona spe.

279. par, ‘in conformity with!

282. necullum sermonem exsequi, ‘to engage in any conversation
at all) Necullum=0136‘ ἕνα, as Capt. 104 necullast spes iuuentutis,
Lucr. V. 839 necutrum. See Munro's notes on Lucr. 11. 23 and lv.
1217. Nec in old Latin has the sense of non, as XII. Tab. ast ei custos
nec escit: hence its uses in the compounds neg-otium, neg-lega, nec-
opinans, in the legal phrase res nec mancipi, in Plautus' nec recte dicere:
male dicere (Asin. 155), and Catullus’ (64. 83) funera nec funera
ετάφοι ἄταφοι. For the use of exsequi cf. v. 686 egestatem exsequi,
Capt. 195 aerumnam exsequi, Pseud. 995 mortem exsequi, where it is an
equivalent for perpeti, ‘to endure.’

283. hoo saeculum, ‘ the present generation.’ So v· 290 hoc genus
hominum.

285. turbant, miscent. For the asyndeton see on v. 210. Mores
is the object, mali the subject. Then mali is subdivided into and
explained by the three singulars, rapax, auarus, inuidus.

The denunciation of the age is perfectly general. It fits Greek quite
as well as Roman life, and we need have no doubt that the passage
is modelled on Philemon's original and not an addition of Plautus’ own.
