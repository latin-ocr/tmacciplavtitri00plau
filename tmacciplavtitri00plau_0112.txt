68 TRIN VMM VS. [ACT 1.

62. ne tu hercle faxo haud nescias, ‘faith I’ll warrant you would
not be ignorant (zyou would soon know) what you have done.’ On -
the construction faxo nescias see v. 60. Ne is the affirmative particle
(ne confirmatiua) to be distinguished from ne* (ne interrogatiua) which
cannot stand first. Νέ is strengthened by hercle, and tu stands between
them just as in ne tu edepol, ne tu ecastor &c.

63. habeas ut nanctu's‚ ‘keep her, as you’ve got her.' ‘You've
made your bed: lie on it.' Rud. 871 ut nanctu’s‚ habe.

mala res=malum, and therefore may have an epithet as nota here.
So Epid. 78 abi in malam rem maxumam. With Megaronides' philo-
sophy cf. Liv. XXIII. 3 notissimum quodque malum maxime tolerabile
dicentes esse, and Shaks. Hamlet 111. 1. 81, 82. As ‘the evil we know
is best,’ so a wife one is accustomed to may be the best after all.

64. nesciam, ‘ I should not know‚' is the apodosis to si capiam.

65. proinde ut bene uluitur, diu uiuitur, lit. ‘just as you live
happily, (so) you live long‚' i.e. ‘long life depends on happiness.’ If
you destroy existing harmony, you destroy with it your hopes of long life.
Many editors transpose diu and bene, reading ut diu uiuitur, bene
uiuitur, i.e. ‘happiness depends on habit‚' ‘you live happily in the way
to which you are accustomed.' But the MSS. are against this—bene
uiuitur diu AP—and this sense would seem to require a perf. in place
of the pres. ut diu uiuitur. For proinde ut cf. v. 659. q

66. sed, breaking off and changing the subject as v. 16. hoc
=lzuc‚ ‘lrither,’ i.e. ‘to me.’ Cf. Capt. 329 nunc hoc animum aduerte,
ibid. 480.

aufer ridicularia, ‘drop jesting.' Cf. Capt. 964 tandem ista aufer,
Asin. 3 3ο mitte ridicularia.

67. quid uenis ‘2 ‘why do you come,' lit. ‘ as to what thing do you
come‚’ the adverbial limiting accus. of the neut. pron. See on V. 35.

68. malis te ut uerbis multis multum obiurigem. From uenis
supply uenio before ut: ‘I come to scold you much with much abuse.’
Multum is an accus. used adverbially like nimium, partim, saltem, διε.
and a few plural forms alteras, joras. See Lindsay‚ L. L. p. 556.
malis uerbis: ‘abuse,' and therefore allows the epithet multis, like
mala res, v. 63.

obiurigem. In Plautus iurgo is still sometimes ionga, and purgo is
sometimes pungo. So balineum, balineator, aalide and other words
that afterwards lost a syllable by syncope, the syllable lost being that
which followed the aecent. [urigo and pumjgo are formed like nauigo,
remigo, ἃς.
