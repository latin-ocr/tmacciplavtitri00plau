58 TRJNVMMVS. . [PROL. ’

8. hunc is the Sycophant whose mission is explained in v. 7. Ut
uenit followed by ut rediit is clumsy.

9. quoius nubunt liberi, i.e. Charmidcs’ daughter is married to
Lysiteles, his son Lesbonicus to Callicles’ daughter. On this use of
nubere applied to a man see Nonius p. 143 ‘ Nubere ueteres non solum
mulieres, sed etiam uiros dicebant, ut nunc Itali dicunt. Pomponius,
Nupsit posterius dotatae, uetulae, uaricosae, uafrae.’

Prologus. It has been pointed out in the Introduction that the
Prologue is outside the play-proper, and is usually delivered by a young
actor in a special dress (ornatus prologi), that most of the Prologues we
possess are post-Plautine‚ but that this Prologue to the Trinummus is,
at least as a whole, from the hand of Plautus himself.

This is one of the cases where the Prologue is delivered by some
allegorical person who does not appear in the action of the play. Thus
we have Arcturus in the Prologue of the Rudens, Auxilium in the
Cistellaria, and Lar Familiaris in the Aulularia. The only difference in
·this case is that there are two allegorical persons, Luxuria and her
daughter Inopia, but as Inopia speaks only a single line and then enters
the house, the departure from the usual practice is not great. Such use
os allegorical persons in Prologues was common in Menander, and was
taken by him from the tragic stage. Thus compare with this scene the

similar scene in the sphere of Tragedy, viz. Eur„ Herc. Fur„ where
Ἴ Iris sends Lyssa (Madness) into the house of Heracles.

The difficulties and peculiarities of this Prologue are excellently dis-
cussed by Trautwein, pp. 23—32.

The curtain is lowered. On the stage in front of the houses are seen
Luxuria and her daughter Inopia, who is sent into the house occupied
by Lesbonicus to do her work.

1. fungaris. The rule by which thes se deponent verbs are regu-
larly followed by the abl. (instr.) is not yet fixed in Plautus’ time. uti
takes generally the abl„ but sometimes the acc„ at least where the
object is neuter, abuti the acc„ frui once in Plautus with abl„ in
Terence four times with abl„ once with acc„ potiri in Plautus twice
with gen„ twice with acc„ twice with abl. Fungor in both Plautus and -
Terence regularly takes the acc. Plautus has this phrase munus fungi
six times, Terence has officium fungi five times, and (fficio ficngi only
once.

2. finem fore quem dicam, a popular and colloquial expression
instead of qui finis futurus sit, common in Plautus with dicere, praedi·
care, arbitrari and credere. ’
