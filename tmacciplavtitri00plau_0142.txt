stituted sor the preceding lines 305-310.

ceeding lines. integumentum, ‘a protection‚’ ‘shield ' for the warrior
depicted in Philto's speech as fighting against inclination.

314. penetrarem me. See on v. 276.

damni conciliabulum, ‘meeting·place of loss‚’ i.e. any place where Ι
should meet with loss by gambling‚ drinking «Sec. σοηαῖἱαύπῖκηι--τσύλ-
λογος. Cf. v. 5 53 hospitiumst calamitatis, Bacch. 80 ut solet in istis
fieri conciliabulis, Cic. Att. xx. 18 area sceleris, pro Rosc. Amer. 134
deuersorium flagitiorum omnium.

315. irem obambulatum, ‘go prowling about‚’ sor the construction

316. neu...parsi sedulo, ‘and I have done my best to avoid causing
you vexation.' Parsi is the common early (and late) perf. of parco, the
reduplicated peperci prevails in the classica] period.

317. sarta tecta, ‘in good repair,' ‘patched and thatched‚' a phrase
properly applied to buildings ‘in good repair and well-roofed.' Cf. Cic.
Fam. Χῐῐῐ. 50 M ' Curium sartum et tectum, ut aiunt, ab omnique in-
commodo, detrimento, molestia sincerum integrumque conserues, whence

what follows. The pronouns are emphatic by position. ‘For your own
interest you have done them, not for mine: my lise is almost spent, for

it looks like an abl„ and hence is constructed with the possessive
pronouns mea, tua διε. Then by analogy the same construction was

320. is probust, quem paenitet &c.‚ ‘be only is a good man, who
is dissatisfied with his goodness and virtue.' In Plautus ‘dissatisfied’ is
the regular meaning of paenitet, it is not used with any idea of repent·

am not dissatisfied with the way in which Ι have been received‚' Pseud.
