SC. 11.] NOTES. 141

feriority of the wife. It would be assumed that she was not good
enough for the higher position.

692. haec famigeratio te honestet, me conlutulentet. Cf. sanuge-
rator, vv. 215 and 219. The clauses are contrasted=nev...64‚ ‘though it
might bring you credit, would cover me with shame.' See on v. 292
where lutitant also occurs. Conlutulentare is formed from an adj. in
-lentus, like opulentare, turbulentare.

694. tibi sit emolumentum honoris: mthi quod. obiectent siet,
‘you would get the increase in honour, people would have a handle
against me.’ Lesbonicus uses honor in an abstract sense: ‘reputation,’
‘estimation.' See v. 663.

695. te dictatorem censes fore ¹2 ‘If, Lesbonicus has said, you
marry my sister without a dowry, i.e. refuse to take the land, the
, increase in honour will be yours.' Lysiteles replies—as if Lesbonicus
meant honor in the sense of ‘office ’—‘ You think that, if I don’t take
the land, I shall get promotion ε do you think if Ι do take the land, that
you will rise to the top of the tree ?’ Dzktatorem=fastzgium honoris.

697. 18 est honos homini pudico, ‘it is an ‘honour’ to a man of
honour.’ Pudicus=a man who has a proper feeling. This is a refer-
ence to v. 661, where Lysiteles says ‘he is sorry Lesbonicus is wanting
in proper feeling (parum pudere).' Lesbonicus is here shewing that he
is not deficient. Is for id by the regular attraction to the gender of the
word following, hic labor, hoc opus est ; lzaec quidem uis est, ea sapienti·
ast3 haec mea culpa non est διο. Honos nom. sing. is a survival of a
declension -οἶς, osis, older than -or, oris. Cf. the adj. honestus, angor
and angustus, arbor and arbustum (arbastus adj. ?). The r in the nom.
came from the oblique cases, and s was retained in flos, ros &c.

698. scio equidem te animatus ut sis. For the antiptosis of te
see on v. 373. Scio equidem v. 353, subolet v, 615.

699. id. agis ut, ‘your object is that.' Effugias and deseras are the
verbs after ut.

700. qu1 uitam colae, ‘and have here no means of supporting life)
See on v. ¹4·

701. ωαηὶεεκενός, ‘empty-handed‚’ ‘penniless.’ N otice the
chiasmus, verb noun adj.‚ adj. noun verb. Cf. vv. 431 and 1 129.

702. adfinitatemzadfines. Lysiteles in his enumeration begins
with Lesbonicus’ nearest and dearest, and ends with ordinary friends.
Cognatos means especially his sister, affines Lysiteles and Philto, amicos
is a general and comprehensive term.

703. mea. opera, ‘all through me.’
