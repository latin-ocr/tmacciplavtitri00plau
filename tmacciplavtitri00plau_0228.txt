point by his interview with Stasimus, who of course does not know the

facts. This completes the complication. Megaronides, who alone has

been told the truth‚ alone understands what Callicles' position really is.
At this point the euolutz'o begins.

SCENE 5 (1093—11 14). Callicles in pursuance of Megaronides'
advice (v. 798 ff.) had gone into the house to dig up enough treasure to
serve as a dowry when the Sycophant had discharged his part. He is
disturbed at his work by the loud summons of Charmides and Stasimus
at the door.

1093. quid hoe 1110 clamoris audio ante aedis meas? hoc goes with
clamoris and lzz’c (adv.) with audio, so that the whole is equivalent to
quid est lzoc clamoris, quod lzz'c audio? Hor. Ep. 111. 5 quidhoc ueneni
saeuit in praecordiis? Shaks. J. C. 1. 2. 79 ‘What means this shouting?
I do sear, the people &c.’

1094. The threefold repetition of the name is reproachful.

1095. qualine? The enclitic -ne is often thus appended, as Pers.
310 ecquid, quod mandaui tihi, estne in te speculae? Hor. Sat. 11. 2. 107
uterne, 3. 295 quone, 3. 317 quantam. Cf. its use in positive sentences
as v. 186.

1096. probo et fideli et fido et eum magna. fide. The four practically
synonymous terms are intended by emphatic repetition emphatically to
repudiate the charge implied by Charmides. See on vv. 199, 1076.

1097. After this line a gap is often marked. Leo thinks the scene
as we have it may be a shortened form inserted in an acting·edition in
place of the full Plautine scene. But, as Ussing notes, Plautus hurries at
the end of his plays and does not willingly repeat what the audience
have already heard. Cf. Poen. 550 omnia istaec scimus iam nos, si ln·
spectatores sciunt, Pseud. 720 διε. The scene itself apologises for its
shortness v. 1101 sed intus narrabo tibi et hoc et alia, and v. 1137 tells
us that the promised explanation has been given.

1098. eredo, omma istaec si ita sunt ut praedicas, ‘I believe
you, if your conduct is all as you declare.’ Credo, sc. tegaudere. 1f you
have been upright and loyal and so forth, I can believe that you are glad
to see me back.

1099. ‚sed quis istest. tuos ornatus? ‘but what is the meaning of
that get-up of yours?’ i.e. the deshabme in which Callicles had been
digging.
