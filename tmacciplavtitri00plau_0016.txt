xii INTRODUCTJON.

and that he wrote the Pseudolus and T ruculentus as senex (Cic.
Cato M. 50). The Pseudolus belongs apparently to 191 B.C.‚
and Plautus to be called senex must then have been not less
than 60 years of age. He died (Cic. Brut. 60) 184 B.C. Thus
his literary activity includes the whole period of the Second
Punic War and the time of Rome's triumph after it.

His life presents nothing but hard work, poverty‚ and mis-
fortune-—a curious contrast to Terence with the favour and
support of the great. Popular as his pieces were in the author's
lifetime he gained his full recognition only after death—especially
from the death of Terence to nearly the end of the Republic—
and his pieces still kept the stage after the establishment of the
Empire.

3. His works. We know little of Plautus' outer life, as little
of his inner life, of the training and equipment he had for his
literary work, nothing of his relations to his contemporaries
Naeuius and Ennius, and to the art-world of his day. His
attitude to his Greek originals we can determine. The Roman
playwright who adapted for the Roman stage had two courses
open to him. He might model his play to suit Roman life,
altering the scene, the customs‚ the names, the dress and so
forth, giving a Roman tone and colouring to the whole. Or he
might with the Greek plot keep the Greek customS‚ places, life
and characters portrayed by the Greek author. If he adopted
the former course the play was known as fabula togata—from
the toga, the Roman national dress, which would in that case
be worn by the actors. If he chose the latter plan, his play was
a fabula palliata, so called from the Greek dress (pallium=
χλαμύς) which his actors wore. Plautus' plays were fabulae
palliatae. (The writers of togatae were later, and generally
represented Italian provincial life. The strict police supervision
and prohibition of politics or personalities made palliatae easier
to write and exhibit than togatae.) His originals were not the
plays of the Old Attic Comedy (480—-370 B.C.), political and
personal, not the transitional Middle Comedy (370—320 B.C.),
but the New Comedy of life and manners ( 320—2 50 B.C.). The
Old Comedy was in truth an exceptional Attic product, which
