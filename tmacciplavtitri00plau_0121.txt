490. Posiui is the true perf„ posui has come from a false apprehension
of positus, i.e. po-silus, as if it were posi-tus, like moni-tus.

146. circumspicedum te. See on v. 98 for dum. The addition of
te, ‘just look round you,’ is Plautine, cf. v. 863, but Mil. 955 circumspice-
dum, ne quis nostro hic auceps sermoni siet, corresponds to the ordinary
usage, i.e. the verb is intransitive. As circumspicere is trans. and takes
an object here, so penetrare is trans. and takes a direct object, vv. 276, ²91 ,
314. The transitive is the older use, the intransitive use a later weaken-
ing. Cf. abstinere, inclinare, praecipitare &c.

arbiter, ‘witness ²—the regular meaning in Plautus—or ‘spy,’ as
Ou. M. 11. 458 procul est, ait, arbiter omnis, Cic. Att. xv. 16. Arbiter
for ad-biter, with r for d, as in the formula SCR. ARF„ i.e. scribendo
assuerunt (adfuerunt), and in meri-dies for medi-dies.

148. ausculto siquid dicae, as v. 98.

149. quoniam hinc est profecturus. Cf. vv. 14 and 112 : quoniam
is temporal and the tense is historical.

peregre is a locative, ‘ at abroad,‘ as Amph. Prol. 5 peregre et domi,
‘abroad and at home.’ But it is also used in the sense ‘to abroad‚’ as
here and v. 596, and ‘ from abroad ’ as v. 4²3 and Epid. 126 aduenientem
peregre, ‘on his arrival from abroad.’ So nusquam=‘no whither ’ as
well as ‘no where,' and intus=÷¹11600ev (Men. 218 euocate intus Culin-
drum) as well as ἔνδον.

151. conclaue is ‘any room that may be locked up,’ specially a
state-mom, whereas cubiculum is specially a dwelling-room.

sed circumspice, inserted parenthetically by Callicles in his nervous-
ness lest they should be overheard. See on v. 124. When Megaronides
has replied nemost, Callicles continues his description of the treasure.

162. nummorum Philippeum ad. tria mnia, ‘amounting to three
thousand gold Philips.' The coin, worth about 16s.‚ was named after
Philip of Macedon, father of Alexander the Great, who minted gold
from the mines near Philippi. Five Philips went to the mina (264).
The coins became current at Rome, where there was no gold currency.
At the time of this play they must have been recently introduced, for
they are not mentioned by Livy before the triumph of Flaminius, 195 B.c.
The second syllable of Philippeus is regularly shortened, and Plautus
prefers the proper name Philippus to the adj. Philippeus. Further he
commonly uses the old short gen. plur. nummum, not the longer form
nummorum. Thus v. 959 mille nummum Philippum, ‘ a thousand (of)
Philippes d'or‚' v. 965 Philippum (aurum), v. 966 mille nummum, ‘ a
thousand (of) pieces,' v. 1158 mille auri Philippum dotis, ‘a thousand
