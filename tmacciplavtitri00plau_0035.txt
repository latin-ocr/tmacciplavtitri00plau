” house there is a hidden treasure (θησαυρός), the existence of

which has been revealed only to Callicles. To save the
treasure Callicles buys the house. This brings odium upon
him. He is represented as abusing his friend's confidence
and making profit out of his missortunes. Accordingly a close
friend, Megaronides, comes to remonstrate with Callicles on
his conduct, but a statement of the facts soon satisfies him
that Callicles deserves not blame but praise <Act 1.).

At this point Lysiteles, the model son of the virtuous Philto,
to help his friend and gratify his own love, induces his father
to ask the hand of Lesbonicus’ sister in marriage. They ask
for her without a dowry, but to this the brother will not consent.
He thinks that to marry his sister without a dowry would
reflect on his own honour, and so offers the only estate he
has left as her dowry. His slave Stasimus dissuades him from
parting with his last possession and tries to deter Philto from
taking the estate by a comic misrepresentation of its fatal

Callicles, suffer her to marry without a portion. He has the
hidden treasure from which a dowry can be provided, but, that

Megaronides to dress up a sycophant, who is to say that he has
brought home money from Charmides (Act 111.).

At this juncture Charmides does return. He encounters
the Sycophant, who has never seen him though he professes
to come from him, fools him gloriously and sends him away.
ΤΙιε meeting with the Sycophant makes Charmides very
uneasy, and his apprehensions are further excited by Stasimus.
But a narrative of the facts shews Charmides how faithful to
his trust Callicles has been (Act 1V.). He agrees to give his
daughter's hand to Lysiteles, and Lesbonicus on promise of
amendment is betrothed to Callicles' daughter (Act V.).

Thus they ‘marry and live happily ever after.' That
Lesbonicus is married as a punishment, that Lysiteles wishes
to marry mainly to save his friend, that Lesbonicus' profligacy
is condemned only because it is ruinous *to the fortunes of the
family, is at variance with modern thought, but agrees with
