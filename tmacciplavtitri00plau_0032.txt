political. Its end was political satire. Such comedy could
exist only under democracy. It rose with the democracy and
it fell with the democracy. Even while it flourished Crates
wrote plays more analogous to the original (Sicilian) type. But
the decay of the Old Comedy was no sudden thing. We may
trace the process of disintegration in the later plays of Aristo-
phanes himself. Thus in the Plutus, which, as it stands, is a
play of the Middle Comedy, there is no Parabasis, and the
Chorus is magni nominis umbra. When we hear further that
it became very difficult to get people to undertake the large
expenses the Chorus entailed, it is evident that its complete
disappearance was only a question of time.

Hence in the New Comedy we expect to find neither (1) poli-
tical satire, nor (2) a Chorus. The New Comedy is almost
wholly social-it is the comedy of life and manners, in the sense
in which we now understand the word. And these are the
topics upon which Roman Comedy was based.

The Romans took over the Greek Theatre as a whole. But
their stage, a mere temporary platform (pulpitum), was more
limited in its resources. The scenery represented a fixed ex-
terior-—a street with houses at the back and a narrow lane
(angzsportum) between them. The frontage of the stage was
great—some authorities say 180 feet. Hence the scenes <e.g.
the opening of the Epidicus) where slaves hurry across the
stage, for owing to its length the audience could keep them
in sight for some time. The doors of the buildings at the back
opened outwards on to the stage. A character coming out often
talks with others inside. And, as the stage represents an
exterior, no interior is shewn. All meetings and conversations
must take place in the street. The Greek Orchestra has dis·-
appeared and the space thus made vacant is filled with the
best seats.

The Chorus of the Old Greek Comedy has also disappeared,
and thus the lyric element proper is lost. The Chorus was
the bond of union in the ancient drama, the basis of its structure
as an alternation of odes and episodes. But N ew Comedy and
Roman Comedy consisted of a series of scenes, which rapidly
