ACT III. (602-819). The narrative is now complete. Act Ι. has
explained the position of Callicles. Act II. has unfolded the marriage-
proposal. Now in Act ΙΙΙ. these two strands are woven together, and
we see how the marriage-project affects Callicles’ position. Here the
complications begin. The expositio is followed by the inuolutio.

The metres of the Act aret Scenes 1 and 2 (602-728), Septenarian
Troehaics‚ Scene 3 (729—819), Iambic Trimeters.

SCENE 1 (602—626). Stasimus has told Callicles that his ward

is betrothed to Lysiteles, They come out of the house discussing the
engagement.

Scenes are osten made to begin, as this does, in the middle of a

conversation. Cf. Asin. 851, Men. 889, Poen. 961, Ter. Andr. 301,
Eun. 391, Haut. ²4²-

602. dixti. See on this form v. 188.

nostrum erilem mium = nostri eri filium, ‘ our young master,’
common in the mouth of slaves. So Rud. Arg. 2 erilis filiae crepundia,
Truc. 297 erilis noster filius, Rud. 198 erile scelus me sollicitat,
followed κατὰ σύνεσιν, as if eri had preceded, by eius me impietas male
habet.

603. despondisse, Donatus makes the distinction ‘spondet puellae
pater, despondet adulescentis? But Lesbonicus is here acting for the
girl's absent father. However‚ the distinction must not be pressed. See
Ter. Haut. 779.

em, 11οο modo, ‘therel that’s what Ι mean.' lzoc modo answering
the question quo modo, as Amph. 1023, A. quo modo? M. eo modo, Sec.

605. in tantas diuitias dabit ‘1 Cf. Asin. 574 ad languorem tua
duritia dederis octo ualidos lictores, Pseud. 928 in timorem dabo militarem
aduenam, Capt. 962 in ruborem te totum dabo.

606. non credibile dicis, ‘ what you say is past belief.’ The MSS.
reading dices is retained by some editors and· defended as meaning hoc si
dices, non erit credibile.

nullus creduas. Nullus as a stronger negative is comic and collo·
quial. Thus nullus sum (Asin. 922) is more emphatic than perii. So
Asin. 408 is nullus uenit, ‘ he never came,' Bacch. 90 nullus tu aelfumk,
Rud. 143 is qui uocauit, nullus uenit, Ter. Eun. 216 nullus moneas,
Hec. 79 nullus dixeris. The idiom is found also in Cicero’s Letters
(Att. XI. ²4· 4 Philotimus nullus uenit) and in Apuleius, an imitator of
Plautus. creditas is an archaic a subjunctive (optative) form, for which
see on vv. 6 and 436. Hence it is used at the end of the line. So
