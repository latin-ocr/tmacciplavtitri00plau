sc. 11.] NOTES. 85

the sentence, Lesbonicus, not to the subject, Callicles, is emphatic from
its position. A gives omnibus.

215. de, of the basis or starting-point, ‘from‚’ ‘on,' passing into a
temporal sense, ‘immediately after.' Roby, L. G. 1907 and 1912. So

de die, de nocte, Most. 697 non bonust somnus de prandio. famigera-
torum, ‘tale-bearers,' ‘gossips‚' a Plautine word.

insciens. So v. 167. Plautus and Terence use insciens only,
inscius is later. But Plautus uses nescius also in the same sense.

216. prosilui casugatum. Prosilui denotes the undue haste with
ν which Megaronides now feels that he has acted: castigatum is supine,
i.e. the acc. of the verbal noun, used after a verb of motion, like ire
spectatum &c-

218. unde quidquid auditum dicant, ‘on which they have heard
anything that they say.’ Vnde=ex qua (auctoritate) and depends on
auditum. Quidquid should probably for the sake of the metre be
corrected to quidque :quodcumque. But old Latin quidquid is used:
quidque without the force of a relative, as v. 881. See also Aul. 198
qui ubi quidquid tetigerunt tenent, Mil. 31 1, Most. 831.

nisi id appareat. The force of si in quodsi is continued. There are
two ‘if’ clauses, juxtaposed by asyndeton, covering the three lines 217—
²19⁹ then these ‘if’ clauses are resumed and repeated in hoc ita si fiat,

, and we have the apodosis to the whole in publico fiat bono. ‘If their

authority were demanded...‚ if, unless it were forthcoming, the tale·
bearer had to deal with fine and flogging—if (Ι say) this were so
ordered, it would be ordered for the general good.’ There is a similar
sentence with a double protasis infr. v. 468 ff.

219. res sit cum damno et malo, ‘had business to transact with,’
used colloquially ‘ had to do with,' ‘had to deal with fine and flogging,'
which are practieally personified by the use. Damnum, a money fine )(
malum, corporal punishment.

220. publleo flat bono, lit. ‘it would be done with the general good,’
an abl. of attendant circumstances, as Amph. 321 olet homo quidam
malo suo, Capt. 499 quid est suauius, quam bene rem gerere, bono publico?
Varro, R. R. 1. 13. 7pessimo publico. See Roby, L. G. 1243.

221. pauci sint faxim δια, ‘there would be few, I’d guarantee, who
(pretend to) know what they don't know, and they'd keep a stricter
watch (or ‘a tighter rein') on their silly talking.’ For the sigmatic
aorist optative faxim and the paratactic construction, see on V. 60.

222. occlusiorem, lit. ‘ more shut up,' is a comparative formed from
the part. occlusus. So factius v. 397. Both occlusior and stultiloquentia
