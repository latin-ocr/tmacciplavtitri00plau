sc. 11.] NOTES. 67

you will not take me in the least bit‚' i.e. Ι shall not get the worst
of the bargain. tantillum δεικτικῶς, ‘not even so little.' Cf. v. 483.
uerborum, part. gen. after tantillum, and dare alicui uerba is a regular
phrase=t0 deceive, to cheat. Dederis here and obrepseris v, 61 are fut.
perfs. in the idiomatic sense ‘you will find that you have‚’ ‘the result
will shew that you have.’ Cf. Aul. 578 ego saxo et operam et uinum
perdiderit simul. See Roby, L. G. 1604. faxo is properly a sigmatic
aorist form. The sigmatic aorist had in Latin a subjunctive in -ο,
faxo, i.e. fac-so, dixo (dic-so), ero (ἥξω), and an optative in -z'm, dixim,
faxim, axim, ausim ἃς. for older dic-siem, like sim for siem. These
forms are used for the fut. perf. and the perf. subj. respectively. Thus
faxo-:fecero and faxim = fecerim. See Lindsay, L. L. p. 465. Faxo is
most often paratactic, i.e. it is only formally juxtaposed with the verb
used with it. According to Sonnenschein (on Rud. 365) with faxo the
fut. indie. is found fifty times in the MSS. of Plautus, the pres. subj.
sixteen times. Both these constructions faxo scies and faxo scias are
paratactic‚ the hypotactic construction faxo ut scias in Asin. 897 is quite
exceptional in Plautus.

61. namque enlm tu, credo. So the MSS„ but Ritschl nempe,
Geppert nanctum enim te credis ἃς. But namque enim is right.
Plautus uses namque in the place of nam before a vowel: thus always
. namque edepol, but nam...edep0l when another word like tu intervenes.
Namque introduces an easily supplied ellipse when it is followed by an
affirmative particle like enim—here scanned as if ene through the slurring
of final m. Enim is an affirmative particle in at enim, quia enim, nit
enim, non enim, nunc enim, certe enim, immo enim, uerum enim and
enim uero. See Langen’s discussion, Beitr5ge, p. 262 ff., where he
maintains that this is the exclusive force of the word in Plautus.
Briefly, in old Latin enim is merely an asseverative particle—cf.
classieal enimuero—in Plautus it asserts and strengthens, meaning ‘in-
deed‚' probably never is a purely musal, ‘f0r‚' but in Terence it begins
to mean ‘fon'

credo is inserted parenthetically and is generally ironical, ‘I suppose,'
‘no doubt)

me inprudentem chremem, ‘(y0u will not get the worst of the
bargain) for you no doubt will be found to have stolen a march
on me unawares.’ ‘You are a likely sellow to get round a simpleton
like me,’ ironically. Obrepere foll. by acc„ though the dat. is the
classical construction, just as occursare takes the acc.‚ Mil. 1047 nam
ita me occursant multae.
