Latin form, is τραπεζίτης. ’ Through AeoIic, which had a tendency to
thrust back r after the vowel (βράδιστος, βάρδιστος, bardus, κρίνω cerno,
κροκόδειλος corcodilus δια), the word passed through Lower-Italy into·
Latin. Z was brought into use at Rome in the transcription of Greek
words only at the close of the Republic. Previously s had been used,
single s at the beginning, ss in the middle of a word. Thus sona: ζώνη,
νηαεεαεμᾶζα, ὀαᾶιζέεοεβαδίζω, ραίνίεεοεπατρίζω. For the history of
the sound see Lindsay, L. L. p. 104. The true Latin for ‘banker' is
mensarius. ’

- mule is by Plautus regularly treated as a ηοιιῃ,;χιλιάς, and so
followed by the gen., ‘a thousand of drachmae.’ So mille nummum,
⁶ a thousand of pieces,' vv. 954, 959, 966, 970, 1139. For the ‘inserted’
vowel in draclzuma beside the Greek δραχμή (anaptyxis or svarablzaktz),
seeIn'trod. p. xxi. ’

426. cohibuisti. The compounds of lzabeo are always scanned in
Plautus as if they were written in the contracted form. Here ‹lehihuistz‘ is
scanned debuisti, cohibeo may. always be scanned as if written* cobeo, and
prohibeo as is probeo. On the other hand praebeo is sometimes written
praehibw, but the scansion is apparently always trisyllabic. See
Lindsay, L. L. p. 143. K

427 a. spopondi...depend1‚ ‘You mean the thousand for which Ι
stood bail ' (nimpe, as v. 328), ‘ Nay, say “ for which I stood payment.’'
If you had only gone bail it would not have mattered‚ but you had to
pay} therefore your statement needs correction.' Plautus uses pendere
in the sense ‘ pay,’ but not elsewhere dependere. But Cicero in his
Letters uses spondere and dependere together just as they are used here,
e.g. Fam. Ι. 9. 9 dependendum tibi est, quod mihi pro illo spopondisti.

427 b. -qua sponsione pronuper tu exactus es. A gives this
‘unplautine’ line before the preceding line. It might be licked into
shape by correcting ‘ quia sponsionem propter tute exactus es‚' ‘because on
account of your bail you yourself were forced to pay‚' ‘were dunned for
payment,' applying exigor :flagitor to the person on whom the demand
is made. But the line is a versified gloss on the previous line and, as it
spoils the connexion, should be bracketed. Pro illo adulescente &ci
follows immediately on v. 427, ‘Nay, say, “which I paid’' for the
youth, whom you declared to be wealthy‚‘ so that according to your
shewing you ran no risk of being called upon for the money.

’ 429. ut 'qumem illud perient. is dependent on factum. Stasimus
takes up Lesbonicus' factum. L. ‘That is true‚’ or ‘That's a fact.'
S. ‘ Yes ! a fact that that money is gone-² So Aul. 154, E. in rem lzoc-
