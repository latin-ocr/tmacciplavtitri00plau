¹⁷ succeeded one another. Any interval was filled up with simple

mu51c.

Yet the lyric element has not disappeared. For (a) The
moral reflections concentrated in the Greek Choral Odes are
now scattered throughout the play, or assigned to some cha-
racters of a moralising turn of mind. And these reflections are
expressed in lyric metres. (b) Again the soliloquy assumes
a prominent place. And to these two partial methods of re-
placing the Chorus we may add a third. (c) Its general function
has been to some extent undertaken by the Prologue and the
Epilogue.

There is another duty of the Greek Chorus which is per-
formed by the Prologue‚ viz., that by which in the Parabasis the
Chorus addressed the audiencein the poet's name, e.g. the
Prologue of the Captiui asserts the high moral tone of the play,
much as does the Parabasis of the CloudS.

But, to go back to the lyric element‚ the Greek Chorus has
left a permanent mark on Comedy in the variety of the metres
employed. The metres of Plautus are not less numerous than
those of Aristophanes. And they give variety, emphasis and
clearness to the whole play. A change of feeling is accompanied
by a change of metre. Lyrics in Roman Comedy are ‘the
medium for the exceptional': accelerated rhythm is used for
any scene of emotion or excitement : the ordinary blank verse
(iambi) for quiet scenes where the action is in a state of rest.

The Greek Comedy allowed incidental effects. Such are the
scenes in the Birds and the Clouds, where a number of persons
are brought in for a moment simply for the moment's laugh.
The Frogs may be said to have an under-plot. At first we are
interested mainly in Xanthias‚ but when the plot proper begins
we hear no more of him. The Roman authors went further
than this. They worked two plots together. And sometimes
to get two plots they combined two Greek plays (contaminatio).
The favourite characters to create this double interest are the
parasite and the cunning slave. Indeed very few Roman
comedies are content with a single plot. And the interest is
heightened in various ways, by doubling the characters and
