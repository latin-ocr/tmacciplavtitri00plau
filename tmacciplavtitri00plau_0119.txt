N.T. use of οἰκοδομεῖν as 1 Cor. viii. 1 and ro. Incohatam is the better
spelling, see Lindsay, L. L. p. 57.

. 133. redderem, ‘duly to pay.' Reddere is ‘to give or deliver to
the proper person money due to him‚’ ‘a letter addressed to him‚' and
so οη,εάποδιδόναι. Non reddereS, ‘you ought not to have paid it‚’ is
an emphatic negation of Callicles’ own words, instead of ne redderes
which strict grammar would require. The imperf. subj. is common of
‘advice applicable to circumstances no longer existing' (Roby, L. G.
1604). Cf. the tenses in the next two lines, Rud. 379 rogas, quid
faceret? adseruaret dies noctesque, ‘do you ask, what he ought to have
done? He ought to have watched &c.‚’ ibid. 842 caperes aut fustem
aut lapidem, ‘you ought to have taken &c.‚’ Pseud. 286 si amabas, in·
uenires mutuom, ‘you ought to have found &c.,' ibid. 437 uel tu ne
faceres tale in adulescentia, ‘else you ought not to have done.’ In
this sense, referring to past time, Plautus always uses the imperf„
classical Latin both the imperf. and the plup. Sonnenschein on Rud.

135. nec qui deterior esset faceres copiam, ‘nor ought you to have
given him any opportunity to damage himself) The instrumental qui
here refers to a fem. noun copiam. For copiam facere cf. Ter. Haut.
Prol. 28 date crescendi copiam, nouarum qui spectandi faciunt copiam,
, ‘give an opportunity of rising (to those) who give you an opportunity of
witnessing new plays.'

136. inconciliastin, ‘have not you entangled,' ‘inveigled into
difficulties ?’ Ne=nonne, as v. 129. In compounded with verbs is, with
hardly an exception, intensive, it is negative only with adj. and parti-
ciples. Inconciliare therefore is an intensive form of conciliare, ‘to
bring to oneself‚' ‘purchase,’ as v. 856. The meaning may be seen from
conciliatrix, ‘a match-maker‚' ‘a woman who entraps people into
matches ’ς hence inconciliarez‘ to embarrass,' ‘to bring into difficulties
by intrigues and the like! Cf. Bacch. 551 inconciliaret copias omnis
meas, ‘ embarrass,’ Most. 613 ne inconciliare quid nos porro postules, ‘ get
into difficulties,' Pers. 834 credo eo, quia non inconciliauz't quom te emo,
‘intrigued,’ and so the third meaning given by Festus, p. 107 per dolum
decepisti. But Langen, Beitrage pp. 181—183, quoting indecet=n0n
decet, infiteri=n0n fateri &c., takes inconciliare = non conciliare, ‘to
estrange,’ ‘to divide.'

137. ille qui mandauit, for illum qui, the demonstrative being
attracted to the case of the following relative where its own verb comes
after the relative sentence. So v. 985, Cure. 419 istum quem quaeris
