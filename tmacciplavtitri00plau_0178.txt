1 34 TRJNVMM VS. [ACT 111.

The scene is more serious than one would expect iu a comedy. Its
object is to shew that the question of the dowry has raised a very real
difficulty, which Callicles will have to meet somehow.

The metre of the last scene (sept. troch.) is continued.

627. sta ilico, ‘stop where you are.’ Ilico here is local with a verb
of rest. See on v. 608. For the sigmatic aorist optative form occultassis,
:perfi subj., see on vv. 60 and 384.

628. potin ut me ire...sinas? ‘can⁷t you let me go?' Potin:
nonne potis (est)=potest impers. See v, 35²·

in rem tuam...g·loriae aut ramae. Are the latter words gen. or
dat.? Are they dependent on in rem tuam or on uidealur esse? On
the whole, Ι think they are genitives dependent on in rem tuam, ‘if I
thought it were to your interest in fame or even reputation.’ But some
excellent authorities (Le03 Roby, L. G. p. xxxix. rather hesitatingly‚
and Ussing) take them as predicative datives dependent on esse uideatur,
‘ if Ι thought it were to your interest, thought it gloriousor even creditable
&cs For this cf. Poen. 145 si tibi lubido est aut uoluptati, sino, where
however tibi is expressed‚ and the construction has nothing analogous to
in rem tuam: for the former view cf. Pers. 34² utrum hercle magis in
uentris rem uidebitur. In rem tuam, see v. 238.

The whole sentence si uz‘deatur...sinam, ‘if 1 thought it...I would
let you (but Ι don’t and so I won't),' is a Plautine pres. subj. of the
unfulfilled condition, as Asin. 188 si ecastor nunc lzabeas quod des, alia
uerba praehibeas, ibid. 393 sz‘ sit domi, dicam tibi, ibid. 427 tamquam si
claudus sim, cum fustist ambulandum.

630. quid id. est? ‘what is that?’ i.e. ‘what does your statement
mean? I do not understand you.' Quid id est? as also v. 32 5, is a request
for further enlightenment on a point already introduced, quid est? is
used when the speaker does not know anything about it.

631. meumst. See v. 445·

632. ut sic odio esses mim, ‘to be such a bore,' ‘so troublesome to
me,'--odi0 predicative dat.‚ a standing expression in this sense.

633. bene quom simulas facere mihi tezquom simulas te bene
facere mz'lzz', but bene by being placed first gets emphasis and balances
malefacis, male consulis.

634. egone? tune, ‘what, I?' ‘yes‚ you.’ Νέ interrogatiua an·
swered by nc· confirmativa, the only case· in which ne? comes after the
pronoun. Cf. Capt. 857, Epid. 575, Mil. 439, Most. 955.

635. tu [mun] es melior quam egomet mihi? ‘are you kinder to
me than Ι am to myself?’= ‘ do you see my interests better than Ι can
