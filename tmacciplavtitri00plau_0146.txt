102 TRJNVMMVS. [ACT. 11.

paralleled by Mil. 321 mirumst lolio uictitare te tam uili tritico, ‘it is
strange that you should live on tares though wheat is so cheap.' Δ

346. edepol deum uirtute, dicam, pater δια, ‘thanks to the gods
(Ι will say it, father), thanks to our forefathers and to you.’ Dicam is
parenthetic: uirtute: beneficio is regular in this formula, see vv. 355,
643, Aul. 166 ego uirtute deum et maiorum nostrum diues sum satis,
Pers. 390 pol deum uirtute dicam et maiorum meum ἃς. For the gen.
pl. deum, with nostrum and meum in the passages quoted, see on v. 241.

348. ne and also ut in ut potius pudeat refer back to multa bona
habemus, ‘we have plenty of property, so that one would not be sorry
for doing a friend a kindness, so that one would rather be ashamed
if one failed to do it.’ Ut is not strictly required to complete the sense,
but is added in antithesis to ne.

350. sed ciui mmuni scm (=sc1³ne)qu1d cantari solet? ‘but don’t
you know the catch sung about an uncontributing citizen?’ For the
spelling of inmunis see on v. 24. Munus means both ‘a gift’ and
‘a duty.' Lysiteles uses inmunis in the sense ‘ungiving‚’ ‘without a
gift,‘ qui nulla munera dat. But Philto v. 354 explains it of a man who
does not possess the means of discharging his duty, who contributes
nothing to the general good, ‘undutiful,’ ‘without a duty.’ Horace
(C. 111. 23. 17, C. lv. 12. 23, Epist. 1. 14. 33) uses the word in
Lysiteles’ sense ‘without a gist‚' see Mr Page on C. 111. 23· 17.

quid solet, not, as it ought to be in a strictly dependent sentence,
quid soleat. Cf. vv. 578, 847.

351. quod. habes &c. The two lines are quoted from some popular
song. Other similar fragments, also in trochaics, are quoted in Teuffel
and Swabe, vol. 1. pp. 14, 15.

352. quandoquidem...a1teri‚ ‘inasmuch as you ean’t allow either
yourself or your neighbour to be comfortable.’

pote is used for potes. Possum is found in old writers in its uncom-
pounded form poti‘s and pote‘ sum. Pete is properly the-nent. of poti&
( pote est = potest), but both mascs and neut. forms are used of any gender
and of either number, e. g. Pseud. 1302 credo equidem potis esse te, scelus,
and so potis and pote are used without sum, as in the common potin ut
i.e. petisne ut: potest ut, ‘is it possible that?’ as v. 628. Cf. Pseud.
1 135 qui neque tibi bene esse patere et illis quibus est inuides, equivalent
to our ‘dog in the manger.’

353. equidem is merely a strengthened form of quidem. E is the
- Indo-European pronominal stem *o (Ἢ) seen in Gk. ἐ-κεῖ, Ose. e-ko (hic),
and perhaps e—nos in the Song of the Arval Brothers. Equidem regu-
