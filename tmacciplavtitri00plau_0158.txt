that the plur. sactiones gets the meaning ‘,wealth' as vv· 467 and 491, ”
and Aul. 167 istas magnas sactiones. Nonius attests this use, p. 304, ²
factio significat opulentzam, abundantzam et nobilitatem. But the pas-
sages seem to shew that factioz‘social position,’ and only the plur.
sactiones, ‘wealth.’ cum uestra, ‘with the standing of your family,’·
not ‘of you individually,’ for uoster never=tuus. So in the next line·
we have uobis, not tibi.

454. sanus mentis aut animi, the genitives are 50- -called‘ genitives
of the part affected‚' i. 0. locatives. Animi 15 100. and mentis is used on*
the analogy of ani'mz, as in Epid. 138 desipiebant 'menna‘ 111 mind-³ The
construction is the same as falsus animi, incertus animi, dubius animi, -
angor animi discrucior ammi, &c., Roby, L. G. 1321. '

455. condicionem, ‘offer of marriage, ‘‚’.match as in v. 159.

456. ferentarium, ‘to lend you a helping hand.’ Ferentani (pps.>
from Sanscr. dlzvarzlaedere) were ‘skirmishers‚' see Sall. Cat.-60. 2,
Tac. Ann. XII. 35. ¹ Perhaps because the Latins derived it *from ferre'
sc. auxilium or arma, Varro L. L. V11. 57, the word passes in this
passage to the sense ‘ ready to assist.’ Fere‘ntarium‚ like sedentarii
Aul. 512. Stasimus, with the freedom of the Greek Comic slaves
first endeavours to induce his master to close with-*Philto’s offer, then
by the grossest misrepresentatio'n to dissuade Philto from accepfing,
as the girl's dowry‚ the one farm left to Lesbonicus.

457. abi hinc (nemete, ‘off with you to the gallows’=‘go away,
confound you.’ Dierectus is a Plautine word, commonly derived from>-
dz' and erigere, as of a slave ‘stretched out ' on the cross‚ but more
likely ‘a bastard issue of διαρρή-γνυμι,’ a word very common in Greek
Comedy. See Nettleship, Journ. of Phil. xv. p. 1862ff. Wherever the
mette is decisive of the point the word is quadrisyllabic, diffrectus, as
Bacch. 579 rece'de lzinc dz‘e‘recte, Poen. 347 die‘recte, &c. In this passage
only, if we keep the MSS, reading abin lzz'nc dz‘irecte 3², by synizesis it is
trisyllabic. Hence it is better with Prof. Palmer (Hermathena Χ. 66)
to read abi binc dzerecte, or aben dte? ecte :² The word is used, either' 111
110111. or as here 111 voe, in this idiom=⁴ go to the deuce,’ e. g. Most. 8
abi ru's, abz α’ῗένεείε, Poen. 160 abi dierectus. See also Sonnenschein’ s
note on Rud. 1170.

81 hercle ire neemiam, uotes, ‘faith‚ if Ι were to begin to go, you
would forbid me.' Hercle properly belongs to uates, but by a kind
of hyperbaton the asseveration is often brought sorward in the sentence
and placed immediately aster si, e.g. Epid. 116 si hercle haberent,
pollicerer, ibid. 326 and 331, Most. 914, Stich. 610. So after ni Mil.
