sc. 11.] NOTES. 65

The Lar changed houses with the family and was propitiated by
prayer and offerings, and likewise was decorated on all occasions of
importance in the family history, a departure (Merc. 834), a return
(Stich. 534), a wedding (Aul. 386). ’

40. uenerare, ‘pray‚' ueneror=0ro‚ a classical meaning. Cf. Rud.
2 57 quisquis est deus, ueneror ut nos ex hac aerumna eximat, ibid. 305
and 1349. With what follows cf. Cic. div. 1. 102 omina maiores nostri
quia ualere censebant, idcirco omnibus rebus agendis, quod bonum faustum

felix fortunatumque esset, praefabantur.
41. euenat. One of the short subjunctive forms used by Plautus

only at the end of the line. Others are aduenat (Pseud. 1030), peruenat
(Rud. 626), also pemcenant v. 93 and euenant (Epid. 321). These are
properly aorist forms and are used by the dramatic poets only under
metrical necessity. So the aorist forms attigas, attulas &c- usually (but
not always) occur at the end of the line. See Lindsay, L. L.‚ pp. 464,
465. Note that euenire is used with adj. (bona &c.) not with adv, So
often in the historians, because euenire almost =fierz2

42. teque. The force of uenerare is continued ‘and pray that I
may see you &c.' Callicles has now turned away from his wife and
speaks these words so that she should not overhear them.

43. Megaronides looking at Callicles says ‘here is the man who in

his old age has become a boy.'
¹ senecta aetate. Also Amph. 1032, and so aetate iuuenta at the end
of a hexameter on an inscription.

puer, i. e. ut castzssgandus sit as the next line shews. Puer was pro·
bably originally *pue-rens· (*puers> puer), and puere is the only form of
the voc. found in Plautus, e.g. Asin. 382 and 891.

45. quoia, ‘whose‚' the possessive of the interrogative or relative
pronoun quoi-us, —a‚ -um‚ formed from the gen. of the pronoun itself.
Being colloquial it is common in Plautus and Terence.

46. tui beneuolentis‚ ‘the voice of a good friend of yours,’ gen.
because quoz‘azcuz'us. Beneuolens is often used as a substantive in

Comedy, as vv. 356 and 1148. And so bene merens is used: ‘bene· ²

factor,’ Capt. 935.

si ita’s ut ego te uolo=si ita es ut ego te esse uolo, almost si talis es
qualem. See vv. 307, 657, 1170.

47. es scanned εἷς. So ege’t v. 330, erz‘s v. 971.

48. atque...Meg-aronides are bracketed as an interpolation by
many editors because of the hiatus, the awkward arrangement, the
pointlessness of aequalis and the fact that Callicles takes no notice
