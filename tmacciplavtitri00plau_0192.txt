give a dowry out of the treasure openly is impossible. Yet a dowry
must be given. It must then be done secretly-—the only question left is
‘ how?' Depromz‘‚ ‘ unhoarded,' taken out of the hiding·place. Cf.
vv. 81 and 803.

ergo igitur is a comic pleonasm‚ found again Most. 847, like etiam
quoque, tum postea, v. 770, and itaque ergo, ergo propterea in Terence.
Apuleius, a regular imitator of Plautus, copies ergo egitur from him.

758. mutuom argentum rogem, ‘I could beg the money as a
friendly loan.' Mutuom as v. 727. Regem potential‚ δανειζοίμην ἄν.

759. potin est⁴1=potestne Ρ See vv. 352 and 628.

760. gerrae, ‘ stuff and nonsense 'z gerrae (γέρρα), properly ‘things
made of wattles,’ used as a synonym for what is worthless, Epid. 233
gerrae maxumae, Poen. 137 gerrae germanae, edepol λῆροι λῆροι meri.
In the same sense nugae, logi (λόγοι), fabulae, somnia.

ne tu fflud uerbum actutum muamus, ‘ you will certainly get at
once (not the money, but) the speech.' By telling Callicles the answer
he will get if he applies to a friend, Megaronides very neatly lets him
know that application to him is useless. And Callicles quite under·
stands his meaning, v. 762.

761. mihi quidem hercle non est, &c., ‘ I, Ι assure you, &c.’ The
difficulty of getting a loan from one’s best friends who plead inability is
often touched upon in Comedy‚ e.g. Pers. 5 fio miser quaerendo argento
mutuo, nec quicquam nisi ‘ non est ’ sciunt mihi respondere quos rogo.

762. malim hercle ut uerum dicae, &c., ‘ I would rather have you
tell the truth than let me have the loan.’ Megaronides has quoted the
reply Callicles is sure to get if he applies for a loan. Callicles replies
in character as if to a friend who had refused him, ‘ Ι see through your
flimsy “non est''—it is not true.'

763. sed, breaking off, as v. 16. The conversation is becoming too
personal. Megaronides goes back to the safer subject of his plan.

764. scitum, ‘ neat‚' ‘ clever.' quid est? See on v. 630.

765. quantum potest, ‘ as soon as possible.' Quantum potest in
Plautus always refers to time, never to extent. Thus Asin. 157 quantum
poteris, ‘ as fast as you can‚' ibid. 607 quantum potest, Men. 435, διε.

766. quasi sit peregrinus, διο. Α post-Plautine line, intended to
be substituted for the four following lines.

768. ignota facie, quae hio non uisitata. sit, ‘ a man whose
appearance is not known, because it has not been seen about here.’
Facies, ‘outward appearance’ generally, as v. 852. Cf. Pseud. 727
qm· hic non uisitatus saepe sit, whence hic was restored here.
