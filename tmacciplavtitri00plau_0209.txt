phant can supply a name, Charmides cuts in with ‘is it “Chares,'’ is it
“ Charmides '’ Ρ ’ To which the Sycophant replies ‘yes Σ Channides.’

923. em, istic erit: qui istum <11 perdant, ‘therel that will be
the man, and may the gods confound him.' Em, see v. 3. Istic erit,
the future of probability, ‘you will find that that is the man,' is highly
ludicrous here. In his relies that the name has been discovered the
Sycophant reveals his ignorance of the man himself. For this use
of the fut. cf. Asin. 734 hic inerunt uzgrz'ntz' minae, Pers. 645 haec erit
bono genere nata, Pseud. 677 sed profecto hoc sic erit. Qui (abl.) is used
in curses and the like in the sense of utinam. So v. 997. Roby, L. G.

dixi ego iam dudum tibi, ‘I told you just now. '—iam dudum,
‘a short while ago,' see V. 608. Charmides has not told him so, but
is that a sufficient reason for marking a gap? Charmides is enjoying
his confusion, and the more inconsistencies he can convict the Sycophant
of, whether fairly or not, the better his end is attained.

925. satin inter labra atque dentes latuit uix· minuml preti ‘2
‘ did he not hide between my lips and my teeth, the worthless fellow ? '
Satin=n0nne. ‘He hid between my lips and my teeth,’ when though
his name was in labris primoribus v. 910, it would not come out.

926. quid ergo me ignamssumus mihi latitabat ἱ) ‘ why then
did the good-for-nothing try to hide from me?' milei, ethic dat.
(incommodi).

927. sl appellasses, respondisset nomini. This sounds to the
Sycophant as a joke. He does not know that it is the bare truth.
He knows that Charmides is the name of the man who is supposed to
have sent him, but he has no notion that Charmides is the man before
him.

928. sed ipse ubist? In v. 901 the Sycophant had said that
Charmides was in Seleucia, now he is at Rhadamas. It is impossible
to fix the locality. The Sycophant may either mean that they travelled
homewards thus far together, or more probably he is purposely made to
contradict himself, as the whole of his pretended narrative is a tissue of
absurdities.

ad Rhadamantem in cercopia. The MSS. give ad Rhadamantem
(Β adz'lzadamante) in Cecropia insula. It is better to cut out insula as
a gloss than to assume a short form Rhadamant, reading ad Rhadamant
in Cercopum insula. The Κέρκωπες figure in Greek mythology, as in
the story of Hercules. They are described as cunning thieves, and
appear as such in Attie Comedy. There were several plays called
