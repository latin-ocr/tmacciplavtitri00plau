sc. ιι] NOTES. 1 05

licet, ‘ certainly‚’ ‘ very well.' ‘Licet ⁹ affirmantis est: faciam ita ut
uis. So v. 517, Amph. 544, Cure. 95, Capt. 949 and Rud. 1210—-
1226, where the whole passage depends for its point on this use of licet.

373. scin tu illum quo genere natus sit? ‘do you know him,
of what family he is born?'= ‘do you know to what family he belongs ?'
an instance of the common prolepsis or antiptosis, by which the subject
of the dependent clause is brought forward out of the dependent clause
and made the object of the principal clause. So οἶδά σε τίς εἶ, ‘I know
thee, who thou art‚’ ‘conceal me, what I am’; nosti Marcellum quam
tardus sit, ‘you know Marcellus, how slow he is‚’ Aul. 1 17 rogitant me
ut ualeam, and in this play vv. 88, 283, 698, 873, 960, 99²·

adprime probo, ‘to a very good family.’ So Cist. 125 adprime
nobilis, Rud. 735 adprime probus (ironical).

3⁷4. grandls=‘of marriageable age‚' as Aul. 191, Ter. Adelph.
673.

3⁷5. sine dote uxorem? ‘as your wife without a dowry?' the
words of the previous speaker repeated as a question in surprise and
incredulity.

ita, ‘even so’z‘yes,' in an answer generally without est, as Aul. 775,
Capt. 262 &a So ita uero Men. 1096, ita enim uero Amph. 410, ita
prqfecto Amph. 370. Ita est only Trin. 196, non ita est Trin. 649.

3¹16. tua re salua, ‘ without expense to yourself '—res as in νν. 230
and 272. ’

377. auxiliarier: for this form see on suspicarier v. 86.

378. egone indotatam te uxorem ut patiar 7 sc. ducere from
v. 375. ‘ What, am I to allow you to marry a wife without a dowry? '
——ne...ut‚ regular in indignant questions, as Asin. 810 egone ut haec
patiar Β, ibid 884 egon ut non domo...subrupiam ?, Pseud. 516 egon ut
cauere nequeam ? ο

380. multa ego possum docta dicta.. quamuis facunde, loqui,
‘ I can quote sage saws by the dozen, as fluently as you please.’ Multa
in close union with the predicate=‘quote in numbers.' Docta dicta,
as Asin. 525 uerba blanda esse aurum rere, dicta docta pro datis ‚2
Possum, ‘I can,’= ‘I am in a position to do so if I choose,’ as Verg.
Georg. 1. 176 multa equidem possum ueterum praecepta referre.

quamuis fammde=tam facunde quam uis. Quamuis in Plautus is
always thus used with an adj. ‚or adv„ never in the sense ‘although,’
i.e. it is always an adverb, never a conjunction. Cf. v. 797, Bacch. 339
ab eo licebit quamuis subito sumere, Men. 318 quamuis ridiculus est.
