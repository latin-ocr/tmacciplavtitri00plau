Nummus in Plautus when it is used without an adj. (aureus, Philip-
pus), where it refers to a definite coin, is certainly a didrachmam a two-
drachm piece. See True. 56² where quinque nummi :1¹15 of a mina, i.e.
10 drachmae, whence nummus=2 drachmae. And this is certainly the
regular meaning of nummus in Plautus—in Terence it is used for ‘a
drachma: But there are passages where the word appears to be used
simply in the sense of ‘a coin.’ Thus Capt. 331 eum si reddis mihi,
praeterea unum nummum ne duis, Epid. 330 (amicis) nummum nullum
habes, Pseud. 1323 hinc numquam eris nummo ditior, in all of which we
should say ‘a brass sarthing ' or ‘ a cent.’ The as and the denarius are
mentioned neither in Plautus nor Terence, and we must think only of
Greek coins. Brix and others argue that three two-drachm pieces is an
incredibly large sum for the Sycophant to have received for so easy a
task as delivering two forged letters. They compare Most. 357 ubi sunt
...isti qui hosticas trium nummum causa subeunt sub falas? which de-
, preciates the sum whatever it is. But the task, if easy, was confidential,
and the Sycophant had to be paid for his silence. He is evidently
hugely delighted with his luck. He speaks contemptuously of the sum
of course, ‘tribus nummz‘s’ ‘a piece or two ’-see on v. 791. But in view
of the necessity of purchasing his silence and his evident delight‚ Ι do
not think six drachmae an incredible sum, and would give nummus its
ordinary Plautine meaning. Ussing argues from the singular >Trinummo
that a single coin is meant equivalent in value to the tribus nummis of
the next line. He thinks an Attie tetradraclzmon, which weighed
almost as much as three staters, may be meant. If Ussing is right, as I
think he is, in his idea that T rinummus is one piece of money equiva-
lent to the tres nummi of the next line, there are great difficulties in the
way of translating ‘three eents' or the like. And in any case the con-
temptuous depreciation lies in tribus, not in nummis. The Sycophant
‘ has hired out his services to lie and swindle ‘for just one or two pieceS‚’
‘ mere three, only three pieces‚’ not for ‘three paltry pieces.' The nummi
may be valuable coin, only it is a pity he has not got more of them.
