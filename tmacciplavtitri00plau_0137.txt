268. sunt tamen quos miseros maleque habeas, ‘ still there are
people for you to keep wretched and in misery.' Τ amen: ‘ even if you
let me alone.' For miseros maleque habeas, adj. and adv. coupled
together, cf. Bacch. 474 Pistoclerum falso atque insontem arguis, Pseud.
110 quo pacto et quantas soleam turbellas dare, ibid. 687 nimis diu et
longum loquor.

269. quos tibi obnoxios fecisti, ‘the people whom you have got
into your power ’—an explanation of the previous line.

270. certa res est=certum est, v. 585, ‘the thing is decided '=‘ Ι
am resolved.' So Mil. 267 res paratam ui pugnandoque hominem caper-
est certa res, Stich. 473 G. promitte. E. certumst. G. sic sace inquam.
E. certa res, and certa res generally closes a line. ad trugem, ν. 1 18.

271. animo labos, the reading of the ‘Palatine’ MSS. A omits
animo.

272. boni, in its social sense, ‘men of family, position, standing,‘
like ἀγαθός )( κακός in the Greek gnomic poets t rem, ‘ property‚'
‘wealth‚' as vv, 230 and 243, fidem, ‘ credit‚' honorem &c.‚ ‘ office,
(political) prestige and influence.’

273. prauum, ‘ reward,' ‘recompense for their labours‚' as Capt. 940.

274. eo mihi magis lubet &c.‚ ‘therefore I rather wish to live
with men of principle in preference to men of no principle and lying
tongues.’ There is no real pleonasm in the use of both magis and
potius, for magis goes with lubet, potius with cum probis. So Asin. 689
magis decorumst libertum potius quam patronum onus in uia portare.

Now that Lysiteles has resolved to avoid a wild and extravagant life,
we are prepared for his proposal to his father that he shall marry and
settle down.

SCENE 2 (276-391). Philto comes out in search of his son. He
laments the degeneracy of the age. Lysiteles claims to have lived an
innocent life, and asks his father's assistance to help a friend in trouble.
Philto moralizes again on the danger of helping the bad so as to seed
their distemper, and utters a number of sententious commonplaces.
He is dismayed to hear that the friend Lysiteles wishes to help is the
spendthrift Lesbonicus, but when he understands that Lysiteles does not
wish to give anything but to receive Lesbonicus' sister without a dowry.
he consents and undertakes to make the proposal to Lesbonicus.

The choral character and the lyric metres of the last scene are con-
tinued. The lyrical monody is succeeded by a lyrical dialogue.
Niemeyer gives the metres as :—-—
