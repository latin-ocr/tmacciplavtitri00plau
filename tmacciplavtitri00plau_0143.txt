sc, 11.] NOTES. 99

305 eho an paenitet te quanto lcicsuerit usui? ‘are you dissatisfied with
the amount you’ve got out of him?’ Rud. 578, Stich. 551. With the
same meaning in Terence (Eun. 1013, Haut. 72) and Cicero’s Letters
(Att. 1. 20. 3, Fam. VI. 1).

frug1 is properly predicative dat. ‘for food,‘ ‘for good' (with the
epithet bonae), then it comes to be used as an indeclinable adj. ‘useful,'
‘honest.’ Cf. Pseud. 337 numquam eris frugi bonae, ‘you’ll never be
any good‚’ Capt. 956 fui ego bellus, lepidus: bonus uir numquam neque
fi‘ugi bonae, Roby‚ L. G. 11. p. xlviii. a.

322. qul ipsus se contemnit &c- The line is often bracketed as
an interpolation. But the language is faultless, and it is Plautine to
express the same notion twice, negatively and positively. Probably the
number of lines in Philto's reply should correspond with the number in

Ι - Lysiteles’ speech. Some editors by making Lysiteles’ speech begin with

v. 312 give six lines to each. But Lysiteles almost certainly begins
v. 313 istaec διε. If then the length is to correspond exactly, this line
must be bracketed to give them five lines each.

323. pax-pluant, ‘roos over your good deeds with other good deeds,
that they may not let the rain through.' This is following out the idea
suggested in v. 317. Lysiteles claims ‘by his steadiness to have kept
his father's precepts in good repair.' Philto replies that it will not do
to be satisfied with what he has done. He must put fresh work into his
roof, if it is to be watertight. Cf. Most. 110 dominus indiligens reddere
alias (tegulas, ‘tiles ’) neuolt‚· uenit imber, perlauit parietes, perpluont.

324. ob eam rem haec, pater, autumant, quia δια, i.e. I did not
speak because I was satisfied with myself, I only spoke because &c-
Ob eam rem explained by quia.

325. dare ueniam, ‘to grant permission,' ‘to consent.’

326. adulescenti hinc genere summo, ‘to a young man of this
town, of high family.' The MSS. give huic which would make Lysiteles
point to the house in which Lesbonicus lives. But Lysiteles does not
reveal his friend's identity until v. 359, and hinc is an almost certain
correction. Ηίηεεαύτόθεν, ‘of this town.' So Epid. 602 hinc Athenis
ciuis eam emit Atticus, Ter. Andr. 8 3 3 illam lzinc ciuem esse aiunt.

327. cog-itate = prudenter, as Mil. 944 haec uti meditemur cogi-
tate.

328. 1111, ‘to him I wish to do a good turn, if you have no objection.'
Illi resumes, after the relative sentence, adulescenti which is some dis-
tance off. Is is the pronoun most generally used for this purpose, e.g.
Asin. 527 illos qui dant, eos derides, Bacch. 386 (arbitror) homini amico,
