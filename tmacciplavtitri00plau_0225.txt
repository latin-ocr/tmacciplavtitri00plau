SC. IV.] NOTES. 181

yet faced or recognised Charmides. Cf. Theocr. xv. 90 πασάμενος
ἐπέτασσε, Pers. 27 3 emere oportet, quem tibi oboedire uelis, Rud. 98
SC. qui nominat me? D. qui pro te argentum dedit.

emi atque argentum dedi, ‘I did buy one and paid my money’
is the full expression, as ν. 115.

1062. dicto amnone, ‘obedient,’ Asin. 544 audientem dicto, mater,
produxisti filiam, Men. 444 dicto me emit audientem, lzaud imperatorem
sibi.

quid. ago? The deliberative pres. indic. is more lively and col-
loquial than the subj. quid agam? It is specially common in this phrase,
but cf. Men. 3²0 obsono amplius? Most. 774 uoco huc hominem? &c.‚
and Roby, L. G. 1609. Magnum malum, v. 1045.

1063. nisi quidem es obnoxius, ‘unless indeed you are under an
obligation to him.’ Charmides has just said that he will take Stasimus'
advice and thrash the slave. Stasimus has now recognised his master,
and as he sees that he has been endangering his back tries to clear him-
self by suggesting that Charmides is indebted to him and must spare
him. So Asin. 284 (we can do our masters such a service) ut aetatem
ambo ambobus nobis sint obnoxii, nostro deuincti beneficio.

1064. sl bonus es. Charmides drops all pretences and addresses
Stasimus as a master speaking to his slave. secus, an adv, noun ‘other-
wise’ (v. 130), a euphemism for malus, and Stasimus in his reply
replaces it by malus. He still pretends not to recognise his master.

1066. partem alteram=quod malist; illam alteram is defined by
the epexegetic quod bonist3 apponito ‘set down to my credit.'

1070. mare, terra, caelum, apostrophizing the three parts into
which from the oldest times (‘made heaven and earth, the sea, and all
that in them is ²) men were wont to divide the visible world: our idiom
is rather ‘heaven and earth,' or ‘earth and sky? On di nostram fidem
see v. 160.

1071. satin ego oeulis plane uideo? Join satis and plane, ‘do I see
aright?' Cf. Epid. 5 Epidicumne ego conspicor? ΕΡ. satis recte oculis
uteris, ibid. 634 satin ego oculis utilitatem optineo sincere an parum?
ἰρειιεεαύτός, ‘master‚’ as ipsima‚ quoted on v. 988, =domina.

1073. saluom te, sc. aduenisse gaudeo as v. 1097, the regular form
of welcome‚ but often cut short by the impatience of the person wel-
comed, as Epid. 128 ΕΡ. saluom leuc aduenisse— ST. tam tibi istuc
credo quam milli. There is a full exchange of courtesies v. 435 ff.

1075. filium atque finam should be nom. in apposition to liberi,
but are attracted into the case of the nearer relative.
