se. 11.] NOTES. 97

302. serului seruitutem, ‘served a regular service to‚’ a strong
and overdrawn way of saying ‘I have steadily obeyed.’ Seruire serui-
tutem, ‘to serve a service,' is an instance of the figura etymologica of
which, because of the alliterati0n‚ Plautus is fond, e.g. dicta dicere v. 77,
uitam uiuere, facere facinora, pugnam pugnare, machinam machinari,
prandium prandere δια, and with nouns and adjs. pretio pretioso,
pulcram pulcritudinem, or advs. and verbs propere properare, aalide
ualere, nz'tide nitere &c., e.g. Amph. 278 optumo optume optumam
operam das. For the asyndeton impertit, praeceptis see on v. 210.

303. pro ingenio, ‘according to natural disposition’=quatenus
ingenium meum spectabam. Ingenium, ‘natural disposition ' )( animus,
‘fancy‚' ‘inclination ἐἐπιθυμίομ pro imperio tuo, ‘according to your
authority,' for imperium :patria potestas as Pers. 343 meum, opino,
imperiumst in te, non in me tibi where a father is speaking to his
daughter.

305. qui homo, ‘if a man’=sz· quis, as Asin. 3²3 em ista uirtus est,
quando usust, qui malum fert fhrtiter, ‘when one can on occasion take a
thrashing like a man‚' Aul. 489 &c. Cf. note on 257.

306. utrum...ne...an. So often in Plautus, e.g. Capt. 268, Mil.
345, Pseud. 709, Rud. 104. There are three particles, but only two
alternatives. Vtrum must still retain in part its old pronominal mean-
ing ‘which thing of two' (cf. πότερον), and is used to shew that there is
going to be a deliberative question with two alternatives‚ which are
introduced respectively by -ne and an.

308. si animus hominem pepulit, actumst, ‘if his inclination has
routed the man, it is all up with him.' Pepulit continues the figure
begun in depugnat. “

309. dum uluit, uictor uictorum cluet, ‘his whole life long he is
called the conqueror of conquerors.' Victor uictorum, ‘the conqueror
os conquerors '= ‘the greatest os conquerors.’ ‘He that ruleth his spirit
is better than he that taketh a city,’ Prov. xvi. 32. Cluet, ‘is called‚'
like audire (‘Matutine pater, seu Iane libentius audis ⁹) ἀκούειν, κλύειν,
bene audire διο. Cf. vv. 496 and 620. Or we may take dum uiuit, ‘in
his lifetime,' i.e. his glory comes at once, not, as with most conquerors,
after death.

311. nimio satiust &c.‚ ‘it is sar better to obey the dictates of duty
than the promptings of inclination,’ lit. ‘to be as it is your duty than as
pleases inclination.’ Nimio, ‘by much,' see on v. 28. Even if this line
is allowed to pass as a not inapt conclusion of Philto's speech, the next
line must be enclosed in brackets as a gloss, and those critics may be
