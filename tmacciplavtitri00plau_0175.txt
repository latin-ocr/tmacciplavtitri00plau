SC. 1.] NOTES. 131

Poen. 747 creditam, Bacch. 476 creduas, Asin. 854 adcreduas, Bacch.
504 creduut.

60⁷. quid? me nili pendere, C. ‘What will you believe ?' ST.
‘that I don’t care (whether you believe or not).’

608. quam dudum istuc aut. ubi actumst *ι ‘ How long ago or
where was the arrangement you speak of made?' Quam dudum as
Amph. 692 quam dudum istuc factum est? Asin. 449 quam dudum tu
aduenis-ti ,9 always implying that it is a slcort time only.

ilico, hic ante ostium, ‘ this minute, here in front of the door.’ ilico
answers quam dudum, lzic ante ostium answers ubi. Ilico (in-*sloco) is
more common in Plautus in the temporal than in the local sense. The
local sense is found only with verbs of rest, as v. 627 sta ilico, ‘ stand on
the spot’z‘ stay where you are,' v. 1059 asta ilico, Merc. 912 istic sta
ilico, Most. 1064 ilico intra limen isti astate. For the temporal meaning,
‘on the spot‚’ hence ‘immediately,' ‘ at once‚' see Merc. 362 nec sacrum
nec tam profanum quicquam est, quin ibi ilico adsit, Rud. 266 ilico hinc
imus, haud longule ex hoc loco ; uerum longe lzinc abest unde adue-ctae huc
sumus, i.e. ‘ immediately, at the moment, we are coming from here, but
the place from which we started, &c.' See Langen, Beitrage p. 155 ff.

609. tam modo, ‘ so ago,' a provincialism for modo, i.e. modo, ‘only
a little while ago‚’ is emphasized by adding tam. The Praenestines are
jeered at as being gloriosi (Bacch. 1 1). Truc. 691 ut Praenestinis conia est
ciconia quotes another peculiarity of their dialect. Festus also quotes
p. 162 nefrones=ncfrendes‚ and p. 356 longere=nosse.

610. frugalior, ‘has Lesbonicus become so much bettera manager,
when he has squandered his fortune, than when it was intaet?’ Fruga-
lior is the regular comparative of the indeclinable frugi. Frugalis is
not used, though the adv. frugaliter is in common use.

611. atque equidem. On equidem as a strengthened form of quidem,
its use with other persons than the first (here e.g. the third), and its
regular employment in atque equidem, quando equidem &c.‚ see on v. 3 5 3.
In v. 941 atque e medio quidem the words are separated by e medio, so
that there is no exception to the rule. ⁴

oratum filio, ‘to beg for his son,' i.e. to act as orator for Lysiteles,
as Ter. Andr. 528 orabo gnato uxorem.

612. flagitium, ‘a scandal.'

613. postremo, ‘finally‚' the consideration which makes further dis-
cussion unnecessary, as v, 662, and so=‘in short.’ Callicles says ‘1 see
that the question concerns me, touches my honour‚' and therefore no
more need be said, his course is clear.
