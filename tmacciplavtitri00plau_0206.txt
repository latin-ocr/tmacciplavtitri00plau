162 TRIN VMM VS. [Ac‘r lv,

you are speaking about ?' 3 but the answer id est nomen mihi shews that
Charmides asks simply quid est tibi nomen ? If mihi stands in the reply ·
there is no reason for doubting tibi in the question. But possibly Leo
is right in thinking that this verse was framed as a substitute for
vv, 883—888.

Pax, id est nomen mihi. Pax is ‘particula silentium imponentis?
as Ter. Haut. 717 unus est dies, dum argentum eripio: pax: nil amplius,
‘say no more‚’ ‘ enough,’ ‘ basta,' and so Mil. 808 Pax, abi, ‘basta, off
with you.' The interjection is Greek, and is explained by Hesychius
πάξετέλος ἔχει. As Leo says it is ‘aptum nomen quod in utraque
lingua abrumpendo sermoni adhibeatur) The name seems to be in-
tended to shew that its owner will not stop to argue or listen to reason,
and so Charmides calls it ‘a swindling name.’ Perhaps we may
translate ‘Basta,'—‘ that is my name.’ N iemeyer gives Prax from
Pseud. 1279.

891. quasi dicas, siquid crediderim nbi, pax—periisse mco, ‘as if
you were to say, supposing I had entrusted anything to you, ‘basta '—
that it had vanished sorthwith.' Quasi dicas, a regular formula used
to introduce a comment or explanation of a former speaker’s words,
as Cure. 78, Pseud. 609 and 634, Rud. 99. Ilico, temporal‚ see on
v. 608.

892. mc homo solide sycophantam, an aside. Solide, ‘thoroughly,'
‘an out and out,’ as vv. 850 and 860.

quid ais tu? the regular formula to attract a person’s attention—a
preliminary question to call attention to the main question which follows.
See on v. 193, where just as here the intended question is postponed for
the moment by the counter·question quid est ?

893. isti tibi quid homines debent ‘2 ‘ what claim have you on
those people?' ‘what business have you with those people?’ So Mil.
421 quid tibi in istisce aedibus debetur? Pseud. 1139 heus chlamydate,
quid istic debetur tibi ? Rud. 117, Truc. 262.

895. manufestanumzmanufhstum=d⁷ff αὐτοφώρῳ. Manusestus is
the early, manifestus the classical spelling.

897. ita ut occepi, si animum aduenas, dicam. A gap is
commonly marked before this line, on the assumption that a question
of Charmides must precede si animum aduortas, dicam, as a question
precedes si animum aduenas, eloquar, v. 939. But it seems necessary
to assume no gap. Charmides is delivering his ‘aside’ for the benefit
of the audience, Stasimus sees that he is not attending to him, and
wakes him up with ‘as I began (which he did, v. 894), if you would
