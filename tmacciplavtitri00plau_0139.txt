sc, η] NOTES. 95

288. habent, ‘ they regard what is sacred as common, state-property
as private property,’ i.e. they don’t know the difference between meum
and tuum, either in their religious or their political life.

hiulca, ‘ gaping.' This is usually taken in the sense of ‘ greedy‚' in
which case the metaphor will be the same as in inhiare v. 169, viz.
eagerly open-mouthed to ⁴get au they can. But perhaps the figure is
rather taken from the gaping of ill-caulked timber, and the meaning is
‘untrustworthy‚’ ‘with great gaps and cracks in their characters‚’=
rimosa.

287 b. canto, ⁴ I din it into you,' ‘ preach to you,' of constant repe-
titions in a monotonous sing-song tone, as Ter. Haut. 260 qui harum
mores cantabat milzi- And so ὑμνεῖν.

288. tantum fas habent...‚ ‘ they think themselves bound to keep
their hands off only what they cannot clutch.' tantum, ‘ so much only,'
quo manus aps-tineam: (fas habent) ut ab eo manus apstineant, a con·
struction like that of dignus &c. Mami, quc-tint, habant, manas. Such
frequent shortenings only in anapaests.

289. cetera ‘rape, trahe, fuge, late‚' ‘with everything else it is
‘⁸ grah, haul, run, hide‚'' ’ i.e. their own words are quoted, as Pseud. 138
qui llaec habent consilia, ubi data occasiost, ‘rape, depe, tene, harpaga,
bibe, es, fuge-⁹

290. quia...durau1‚ ‘ because I have lived to see the present race of
men.’ Durare αείεέπιδεῒν. The clause is dependent on lacrumas haec
mihi eliciunt: lacrumo (cf. Mil. 1328 lacrumo quia dz'iungimur). After
verbs of the affections‚ joy, sorrow, anger and the like, Plautus almost
invariably uses quia not quod, and, generally, following colloquial usage
he prefers quia to quod. See Langen, Beitriige, p. 55 ff.

291. quin prius me ad pluris penem-aui? ‘why did I not sooner
wend my way to another world,’ or ‘ join the majority?’ Perhaps ‘why
was I not sooner gathered to my fathers ? ’ might serve as an equivalent.
Pluris, ‘the majority,' is an euphemism to avoid saying ‘the dead.’ So
Petronius, Sat. 42. 12 abiit ad plures, and Ar. Eccl. 1073 γραῦς ἀνεστη-
κυῖα παρὰ τῶν πλείονωνεπαρὰ τῶν τετελευτηκότων.

292. nam ni mores maiorum laudant, eosdem lutitant. quos con-
laudant, ‘for though the men of the present day praise the ways of
their fathers, they heap contempt upon the very people they eulogise.’
This is Philto’s reason for wishing himself dead. His contemporaries
honour the past with their words, but dishonour it by their deeds.
Lutitant, ἅπαξ εἰρημένον, is a frequentative from lutum, lutare, meaning
‘to bespatter with dirt,’ ⁴ bring into contempt.’ Cf. conlutnlentet‚
