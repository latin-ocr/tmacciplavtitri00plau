Κέρκωπες (Koch, Com. Att. frag. 111. p. 698), and there is supposed
to have been an ἀγορὰ Κερκώπων, where stolen goods were sold. The
name Κέρκωπες, as if from κέρκος, has given rise to the story that the
Cercopians were turned into ‘apes’ and banished to the ‘Monkey
Islands‚’ Harpocration, p. 110, Ou. Met. XIV. 90.

930. sed nil disconducit huic rei, ‘still it serves my turn very well.’
Dz'sconducit ἅπαξ εἰρημένον = obest, huic rei is explained v. 900 mihiquoque
edepol, quom lu'c nugatur, contra nugari lubet. And in pursuance of his
purpose Charmides proceeds to extract from the Sycophant an account
of his imaginary adventures. The Sycophant in his story says ‘we‚'
i.e. ‘Charmides and 1⁹3 Charmides in his questions and comments
always says ‘you,’ ‘znd (pers. sing„ i.e. the Sycophant only.

quid ais? See v. 193.

931. nimium mirimodis mirabiles, ‘ places wondrous in very
wondrous wise‚’ ‘ places very marvellously marvellous.' Mirimodis
:miris modis, and is like multimodis and omnimodis, which last is pro·
bably formed on the analogy of the other two. Mirimodis and multi-
modis are regular in Plautus, though multis modis occurs Rud. 837, and
omnibus modis often, as Aul. 462, Merc. 920, Pseud. 1074. For the
use of the plural (modis not modo) see Langen, Beitrage‚ p. 111 f.
Lucretius is fond of these forms, see Munro on Lucr. 1. 683. Nimium,
as v. 28.

933. in Pontum aduecti Arabiam terram sumus, i.e. in Pontum
uectz' Arabiam terram adnecti smnus, ‘on our voyage to the Pontus we
touched at the land of Arabia.'

934. eho, an? ‘hallo! is Arabia actually‚' ‘hallol do you mean to
say that &c.’ See on v. 55 Elzo an, continually at the beginning of the
line, as Bacch. 200, Epid. 506, Mil. 821, Pseud. 968, &c-

935. apsinthium...atque cunila gallinacea, ‘but the place where
the wormwood and the henbane is grown.' These came from the
Pontus. Pliny (N. H. XXVII. 45) praises absinthium Ponticum, and
cunila is a species of origanum which is specially connected (N. H. xx.
169) with Heraclea Pontica. Cunila is the Greek κονῗλη. Ritschl and
others, despite the quantity in Greek, would accentuate a‘tque cu‘ni‘la.
On this, and the accentuation of Greek lom-words generally, see
Lindsay, L. L. p. 155.

936. nimium graphicum hunc nugatorem. See on v. 769 and ef.
v. 10²4· The whole is acc. of exclamation, as v. 128.

Ritschl objects to sed ego sum insipientior &c- as a dittographia
