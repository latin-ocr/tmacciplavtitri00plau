207. sciunt ld quod tn aurem rex reginae dixerit. Reize, per-
haps rightly in view of the subj. dixerit, suggests sciunt quid διο. By rex ’
reginae the ἄρχων βασιλεύς and the βασίλισσα, mystically married at the
Anthesteria, have been understood. It seems more probable that, if there
is any definite allusion, it is to the Great King, the Persian monarch‚ who
was the type of monarchy to Athenian eyes. But is not the expression
popular and proverbial? Cf. Stich. 133 suos rex reginae placet, where
there is no allusion to any sovereign, and the proverbial turn of the next
line, with which cf. Theocr. Id. XV. 64 πάντα ’γυναῖκες ἴσαντι, καὶ ὡς
Ζεὺς ἠγάγεθ’ ”Ηραν. Wagner aptly quotes Butler's Hudibras, Canto 1,

‘ He knew the seat of paradise,

Could tell in what degree it lies;
What Adam dreamt of, when his bride
Came from her closet in his side;
Whether the devil tempted her

By a High Dutch interpreter’ &c.
