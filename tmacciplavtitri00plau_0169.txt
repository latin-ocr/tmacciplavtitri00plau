sc. 1v.] NOTES. 12 5

555. at tu hercle et 1111 et aubi, sc. malam rem ( :malum)quaeras,
i.e. you won’t have to go there to get the thrashing you deserve. Illi as

v. o.
538110 818 dixeris. See on caue sis fi’ceris v. 513.

556. arcano, as v. 518.

557. mum sc. agrum, ‘ Lesbonicus is anxious to get the ownership
of the land transferred from himself,' i.e. to get it conveyed to someone
else. Scan lzi‘c quidem, which is pronounced and sometimes written
mquidem. See Lindsay, L. L. p. 433.

558. quoi os subnnat, ‘if only he could find someone to hood-
wink.’ Os sublinere, ‘to gull,’ a common expression in Plautus (Capt.
783, Epid. 429, Mil. 110, Pseud. 719), apparently ‘to smear the face of
a person who is asleep‚' hence ‘to bamboozle,' ‘to befool.’

The oldest form of the dat. of the relative is quoiez' in an epitaph os
130 B.c. (C. Ι. L. 1. 34), but the regular form in inscriptions of the
Republic is quoi. Some editors introduce quoz‘z‘ here and v. 358, cf.
Rud. 1193, but the dissyllabic dat. does not occur in Plautus. See
Lindsay, L. L. p. 445, Miille'r, Handbuch 112. p. 349, Gsses, Manual
326. ii.

559. πιὸῖιε quidem hercle, as v. 58.

560. This line and the next are spoken aside and not meant for the
ears of Philto.

561. nam qui uiuamus nil est, si inum amiserit, ‘we have no
means of living, if Lesbonicus parts with the farm? lllum=agrum,
for nil est qui uiuamus, see v. 14.

l 562. sodes, See v. ²44·

563. quid censes? sc. eum locutum esse. Philto is true to his
promise not to reveal what Stasimus has said. Accordingly he turns
aside Lesbonicus’ question. ‘What do you suppose (he said)?' He
talked on what was naturally uppermost in his mind, viz, how he could
get his freedom.

565. nequiquam uolo, as v. 440.

556. licitumst, 81 uelles: nunc, quom ml est, non licet, ‘you once
could have been, if you had chosen: now that you have got nothing, you
can't.' quom m‘l est=in re perdita v, 609. For the use of the imperf.
subj. see note on v. 133. From the next words it is clear that Stasimus
grumblingly mutters this to himself.

567. quid tecum? sc. loquere, ‘what are you muttering to yourself?'

Cf. Most. 512 quid tute tecum loquere? ibid. 551 quid tute tecum .?
de istoc quod dixti modo, “I was muttering to myself) about
