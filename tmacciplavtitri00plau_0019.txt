J not scruple to depart from his original, or to introduce many
ξ allusions to Roman customs, events, laws, places and men, which
shew how little he was tied by the fact that he had an original
'j' before him. The Greek framework is largely filled with pictures

' taken from the Roman life around him. The modern parallel

would be not the German translations of Shakspere, but the
Comedies constantly produced in England ‘after the French,'
⁷ where the difference between French and English taste on
many points necessitates often a very wide departure from and
extensive modification of the French playwright's workl. The

’ style of Menander.

4. Text. The text of Plautus depends on MSS. of three
classes, In the first class stands a single MS. A, the famous
Ambrosian Palimpsest—the oldest Latin MS. extant—now in the
Ambrosian Library at Milan. It is dated as belonging to the
4th or 5th cent., but the codex was separated and written over
by a monkish scribe in the 7th or 8th cent., and now there
survives about a third part of the leaves with the original
Plautine text under the Vulgate of the monk. Imperfect and

32³2: difficult to decipher as even this remnant is, it is of supreme

’ importance for the text of Plautus. Nothing is left of the
Amphitruo, Asinaria, Aulularia, Curculio, little of the Captiui,
Cistellaria, Vidularia3 of the other plays altogether about
half is extant, but in different proportions, so that of the
Pseudolus and Stichus little is wanting3 less than half is lost of
Casina, Persa, Poenulus ; about half of Epidicus and Trinummus;
more than half of the Bacchides, Mostellaria, Menaechmi,
Mercator, Miles Gloriosus, Rudens, Truculentus. The MS.
was discovered by Cardinal Mai 1815—an Apograph has been
published by W. Studemund.

In the second class fall four MSS. proceeding from one source :
