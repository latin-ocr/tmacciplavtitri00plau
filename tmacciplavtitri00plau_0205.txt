SC. 11.] NOTES. 161

882. faxo sciaS, see on v. 60.

884. magnum facinus incipissis petere, ‘a superhuman task,’
‘something of exceeding difficulty,’ more grandiloquent than the usual
magna res. Cf. Mil. 228 magnam illic homo rem incipissit.

885. si ante lucem ire hercle occipias a meo primo nomine, ‘I
assure you that if you were to start before dawn on your journey from the
beginning of my name &c.' There is gap with space for six letters before
ire in B. I have provisionally inserted Ritschl's hercle after ire, which is
at least idiomafic, for the asseveration gets into the si clause, see on v.
4 57, but usually comes immediately after si. Niemeyer writes biti in place
of ire, but common as are perbitere‚ interbitere, adbitere, abitere, rebitere,
we want evidence for a deponent form bitor. Prof. Palmer suggests ire
itere, ‘to go on a journey.’ A meo primo nomine, ‘from the beginning
of,' like prima uespera Curc. 4, primulo diluculo Amph. 737, prima uia
Mil. 2 53, digitulis primoribus Poen. 566 &c- And so ad postremum, ‘to
the end of it)

concubtum sit· noctis, ‘the dead of night) Varro, L. L. vu. 78
concubium a concubitu dormiendi causa dictum.

887. opus factost uiatico, ‘one must get travelling-money for your
name.’ Charmides enters into the Sycophant's humour. But facto is
probably not right: opus est uiatico is the regular idiom, and if anything is
added it should be an adj. with the meaning of magno, as Wagner sug-
gests, such as firmo, forti, or a participial adj. like parto.

888. iuxmum B, uixillum CD, uasculum F Z. The latter is osten
adopted, where uasculum uinarium means ‘ a little wine—glass‚’ uinarium
being an adj. Another reading is uesculum uinarium, where uesculum
is ἅπαξ εἰρημένον, a diminutive of uescus ‘thin,' and uinarium is used as
a noun, as it is Poen. 838, ‘a thin wine-jug? But these readings do not
account for the reading of the better MSS. The best suggestion is
Ussing’s‚ who proposes uexillum uinarium, ‘a wine-label' or ‘ticket.’
The notae put on the casks might very well have had the shape of a
uexillum, and so get the name. And they would only contain a few
letters to indicate the wine contained in the cask, like the sillybi of
books and our decanter-labels with their S. W.‚ Ι. W. and so on.
These abbreviated descriptions would stand to the full title in the same
relation as the Sycophant's short name to his suu name. Leo‘s note is

fhrtasse cogitari potest de ‘uix' quasi nomine deminuto (⁴nagelprobe'),
which is perhaps right.

889. quid est· tibi nomen? ‘what is your name?' We should expect
quid id (istuc) est nomen? without tibi, ‘what is that name, the name
