Athenian'comedy. The story is a well-drawn family history,
excellently told and regularly developed‚ the characters are all
typical and are sketched with care. The old men, Charmides,
Callicles, Megaronides and Philto, are all distinct types, and
their characters are consistent and form effective contrasts.
The highly moral Lysiteles is an excellent soil to the spendthrift
but good-hearted Lesbonicus. The comic element proper is
supplied by the slave Stasimus and the Sycophant.

The play is disfigured by no grossness; it is a quiet play
(lenis, stataria, as contrasted with motoria a lively bustling
play, such as the Asinaria). It is a remarkable feature that
the T rinummus, like the Captiui another moral play, has no
female character among the dramatis personae.

If we analyse the play we find that Act Ι. contains the
narrative of the facts as unfolded in the conversation between
Callicles and Megaronides Act II. introduces us to the family
of Philto and the proposal of marriage. Act ΙΙΙ. developes
the complications that arise on the unwillingness of Lysiteles
to impoverish his friend by accepting a dowry, and the
reluctance of Lesbonicus to allow his sister, and of Callicles
to allow his ward, to marry without a dowry. These complica-
tions are further complicated by the mission of the Sycophant.
Act IV. relates the discomfiture of the Sycophant‚ but leaves
Charmides till the end in uncertainty as to the true state of
things. With the explanation of Callicles the unravelling of
the difficulties begins. Act V. clears up the difficultieS, and
all ends happily. Thus vv. 23--601 contain the expositio,
vv. 602—1092 the inuolutio (entanglement), vv. 1093—1189
the euolutio (disentanglement).

In the structure of the play it should be noted that there are
two distinct interests: (1) the difficult position of Callicles, (2) the
marriage negociations‚ and that these two plots are worked
together side by side and for the most part kept distinct by the
different metres employed for each. The Callicles plot is
worked in iambic metre, i.e. as we should say in blank verse3

the marriage plot is worked in lyrics or accelerated rhythm.
