se. 1v.] NOTES. 179

Brix quotes an excellent example of the meaning of malum and mala res
from Livy lv. 49. 1 ι. Postumius Regillensis threatens ⁴ malum quidem
militibus meis nisi quieuem‘nt,' whereupon a tribune comments‚ auditis,
Quirites, sic ut seruis malum minitantem militibus. Malam rem = malum
and therefore can take the epithet magnam.

1046. non hoe publice animum adum-ti, ‘and to think that the
state does not interfere.’ Hoc, object after animum aduortz’: animad-
η uerti. publice as in v. 548.

104⁷. uniuersis...omm, ‘that class of men (=istis v. 1043) is
prejudicial to the world at large and does harm to any people.’ Omni
as v. 338.

1048. fldem...fldem‚ the first means ‘faith,' the second ‘credit,’
‘by not keeping saith they destroy the credit of people who have done
no wrong) quoque...etiam not a mere pleonasm, for quoque compares,
etiam intensifies. The words in the order quoque etiam may come
together, but in the reverse order they are always separated. Thus
Asin. 502 etiam tu quoque, Epid. ²34 quoque etiam.

1049. quippe eorum ex ingenio ingenium horum probant, ‘for
people judge the character of the innocent from the character of the
guilty.’ Eorum=qui male fidem seruant,· horum i.e. qui nil meriti
sunt. Probant, as Pers. 213 tuo ex ingenio mores alienos probas, in
the sense of aestimant. There is also a change of subject, for the
subject to abrogant is isti implied in id genus hominum, the subject to
probant is the indefinite ‘ they‚’ i.e. people generally. Cf. for the change
of subject v. 813, Men. 454 qui (i.e. homines otiosi from previous line)
m‘sz· adsint quom citentur, census capiant (sc. censores) ilico, Capt. 266
nunc senex est in tonstrina: nunc iam cultros adtinet (Philocrates),
Pseud. 58, Pers. 616 &c., always where there is no sear of mistake from
the change.

1050. hoc qul in mentem uenerit mihi ‘1 ‘do you ask how this
carne into my head?’ The question is indirect and quaeris is felt if not
expressed. Similar indirect questions are Bacch. 75 utrum ego istuc
iocon adsimulem an serio? Epid. 215 id adeo qui maxume animum
aduerterim? Ter. Andr. 191 lzoc quid sit? where Donatus notes
’ἔλλειψις, deest enim quaeris.’

re ipsa, ‘I have just been reminded of it by actual experience‚' sc.
in losing the ring.

1051. pro proprio, ‘if you have given a man a friendly loan, instead
of being your property it is lost‚' ‘it is no longer good money but
gone.’ Mutuom, see on v. 728.
