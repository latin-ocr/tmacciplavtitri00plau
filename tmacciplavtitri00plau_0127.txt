recte facis, uox comprobant& )( benefacis, uox gratias agentis. See
on v. 384.

198. numquid &c. See on ν. 19²· Finding that Megaronides
has exhausted his questions, Callicles withdraws. Megaronides finishes
the scene by a soliloquy.

:The soliloquy depicts the eager curiosity of Athenian gossip. For
their political curiosity see Dem. Phil. 1. ¹03 and this whole side of the
Athenian character is admirably caught, Acts xvii. 21 ‘Now all the
Athenians and the strangers sojourning there spent their time in nothing
else, but either to tell or to hear some new thing.' As the N ew Attic
Comedy is wholly social, such traits of character are constantly handled.

199. stultius neque stolidius. The two words are identical in
derivation and differ little in meaning. The idea is emphasised by being
stated twice in terms nearly the same.

200. mendaciloquus and confidentiloquus are expressive compounds
coined by Plautus.

neque arg-utum magis. A gives neque adeo argutum magis. If
this is kept we must read neque mendaciloquom neque adeo argutum
magis, where magzlr applies to both adjectives as acrius does to both verbs
in v. 169. But if this reading is adopted, it becomes almost inevitable
to transpose lines 201 and 200 so as to bring neque adeo to the end of the
list. Its position in the middle is awkward. So that on the whole

' it is safer and simplet to cut out adeo and leave the lines in their present

order.

201. confidentiloquius, ‘more brazen in speech.’ Confidens in
Plautus is generally in malam partem, ‘ impudent,' ‘brazen-faced.’

penufius :per-iarius, and so peiero where the r of per has been
dropped owing to the consonantal value of the i.

202. quam urbani adsidui ciues, quos scurras uocant, ‘than your
fine busybodies of citizens whom they call men about town.' Adsiduus
(adsedere), a man always present and occupied with something. Cf.
deses idle (desideo). Urbanus )( rusticus, ‘in the city style,' thinking
himself a polished gentlernan.

scurras, ‘dandies,' ‘flfineurs,' young, well-dressed, idle men of
fashion who frequent the regular places for gossip and discuss everyone's
affairs. Cf. Epid. 15 where scurra is opposed to hamo militaris, Most.
15 tu urbanus uero scurra, deliciae popli, rus mihi tu abactas? Truc.
49¹ non placet quem scurrae laudant, Catull. 22. 12. But in Horace
scurra :parasitus in Plautus.
